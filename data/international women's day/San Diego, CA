So not doing well emotionally. Dysphoria from International Women’s Day has hung on like an unwanted houseguest. All at once, I feel more non-binary than ever, but also frustrated at the constant assumption by cis people that non-binary people want to be lumped in with women.
Happy International 
Women's Day!

*Recognize women's credibility during introductions. “Donna is lovely” is much less useful than “Donna knows shitloads about architecture”

*Cast women in parts written for men. We know how to rule kingdoms, go to war, be, not be, and wait for Godot.

The origins of "International Women's Day"

The Bolsheviks (USSR) came up with this as a way to keep women in their places.  Women were equal as factory workers - but no women EVER rose above that into a position of leadership in the USSR. Like Earth Day, this is a Soviet ploy. https://t.co/tE56Bm1d36
Boys are so dumb. Anyways Happy International Women’s Day💕🌸🌷💞💓💐💖
