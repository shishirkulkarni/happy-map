Well, since I already did this for International Men's Day, I thought I'd do the same for #InternationalWomansDay:
Everyday I am grateful for women who have made me into the person I am today; my grandmother, my aunt, my cousins, my teachers, counselors, therapists (Cont.)
Happy International Women's Day everyone. I didn't know this was a thing. It seems every day should already be this because none of us stupids would be here without them. Lots of people would be lonely and lost without them. A planet full of lonely lost people sounds depressing.
