Is today international women’s day? Or was that yesterday? Either way it sounds like a last second made up holiday.
International Women's Day was founded to celebrate the global achievement of economic, social, and political equality between men and women. With their own oppression long since overcome, many women took up the causes of other still-oppressed peoples.
