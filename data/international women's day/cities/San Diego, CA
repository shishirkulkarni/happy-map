So not doing well emotionally. Dysphoria from International Women‚Äôs Day has hung on like an unwanted houseguest. All at once, I feel more non-binary than ever, but also frustrated at the constant assumption by cis people that non-binary people want to be lumped in with women.
Happy International 
Women's Day!
