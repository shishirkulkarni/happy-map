Got a free mandarin-infused vodka shot at a Russian bar for International Women’s Day which is really what it’s all about I think
regardless of it being international women’s day, that should be tolerated everyday. its not like suddenly tmrw we’re not strong, beautiful nor are we not women. we do a lot of shit for our own u feel me? jus cus im talkin ab females that doesnt mean that we are better than men!!
today is international women’s day and i hooked up with a married man in the dominican republic
For those of you who are complaining about IWD, just remember that in some countries, women aren't even considered people. There was a period of time in when this was true of American women. Representation matters.

Happy international women's day.
I have no doubt the world would be a much better place if women ran the show. Happy International Women’s Day!
Yesterday was national pancake day and today is international women’s day and I think that’s such a beautiful thing bc I love eating both

I'm confused.  The first #Internationalwomensday was March 19,1911 before we had 76 genders.. Does the day need to be broken down?  Do we need International Autigender Day, International Demigirl Day or International Polygender Day? Women's day seems very exclusionary.
