And the International Women's Day section on YouTube seems to be all white girls. Thanks. I don't really want to see a Little Mix video but you've given me it anyway.
Hang on a minute @YouTube, you've given me a whole International Women's Day section but when it was Black History Month you just kept telling everyone to subscribe to black content creators without much effort to push their videos. I don't understand you anymore.
Dear men,

It's the 19th of November, before you spend all day replying to International Women's Day asking when your day is.
