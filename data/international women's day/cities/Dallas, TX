Hang on a minute @YouTube, you've given me a whole International Women's Day section but when it was Black History Month you just kept telling everyone to subscribe to black content creators without much effort to push their videos. I don't understand you anymore.
Dear men,

It's the 19th of November, before you spend all day replying to International Women's Day asking when your day is.

That's quite special. Jeremy Corbyn accused by the PM of "mansplaining" by telling her that it's International Women's Day tomorrow. Perhaps a woman could explain to her, so as not to upset her, that he was talking to the speaker and not her directly. #PMQs

Yeah, nah. You don't get to make a stupid joke about mansplaining which completely undercuts International Women's Day tomorrow just because you're a woman.

You are the PM, you have a responsibility to respect and promote IWD rather than using it to attack Labour #PMQs
