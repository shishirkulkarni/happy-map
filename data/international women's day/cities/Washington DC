International Women's Day was as illuminating as always. It shows not just how far we've come but also how far we've got to go. The aggressive and spiteful negativity from some quarters is exactly why the day is still needed and valuable.
This just goes to show how regressive some modern day feminists can be and why I, as an egalitarian, think twice before associating with someone I don't already know when they tell me they're a feminist.
