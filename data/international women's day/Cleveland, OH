Yesterday I heard to women discussing International woman's day and the  progress that's been made.

Only thought in my head was the time I had to explain to a dude that you shouldn't rape drunk women. UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!!!
Equality is having an international women’s day, and an international men’s day. Or neither. Have a black history month, as well as every other race. Or neither.
Oh forgot to tell ya’ll, on international women’s day I ran into a man who hates me because I told him off for objectifying women. So it was a pretty great day!
