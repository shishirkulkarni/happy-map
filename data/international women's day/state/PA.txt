International Women’s Day is not only about high profile women; it’s also about the domestic workers, the hotel maids, the cashiers, etc. - women take on a lot of low-paying jobs in addition to unpaid labour in the home.

Based on my timeline, International Women’s Day is:

A march for women’s rights in Istanbul
Transit workers striking to protest unequal treatment in Spain
A peace demonstration in Infrin
And corporations telling us about women CEOs or W-arches or “supporting women” in the USA.

regardless of it being international women’s day, that should be tolerated everyday. its not like suddenly tmrw we’re not strong, beautiful nor are we not women. we do a lot of shit for our own u feel me? jus cus im talkin ab females that doesnt mean that we are better than men!!
today is international women’s day and i hooked up with a married man in the dominican republic
For those of you who are complaining about IWD, just remember that in some countries, women aren't even considered people. There was a period of time in when this was true of American women. Representation matters.

Happy international women's day.

As a woman in a male dominated career field, I’m not sure why we need to have a day called International Women’s Day to “empower” us and the women around us. #unpopularopinion
Every year on International Women’s Day that Pat Robertson quote about feminism makes the rounds with every third person commenting “failing to see the problem here lol.” It’s like a law of nature
International Women’s Day has long been used by brands to garner some extra buzz for attaching themselves to feminist causes. This year, however, the pressure to do so is especially high.

I'm confused.  The first #Internationalwomensday was March 19,1911 before we had 76 genders.. Does the day need to be broken down?  Do we need International Autigender Day, International Demigirl Day or International Polygender Day? Women's day seems very exclusionary.

Every site I get some sort of news from (Vice, Hypebeast, etc.) thats posted something about International Women’s Day is FULL of dudes with negatives comments. We gotta do better y’all niggas weird, why y’all hate women so much?
I had honestly never heard of International Men’s Day until I googled it today. I thought it didn’t exist. 

But that just goes to show you how as a society we often neglect men and make them feel unappreciated.

Men should be and deserve to be celebrated just as much as women.
