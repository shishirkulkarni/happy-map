Hang on a minute @YouTube, you've given me a whole International Women's Day section but when it was Black History Month you just kept telling everyone to subscribe to black content creators without much effort to push their videos. I don't understand you anymore.
Dear men,

It's the 19th of November, before you spend all day replying to International Women's Day asking when your day is.

Google, seriously?  
That’s your “International Women’s Day” story?

Guy meets “Girl”
Guy and “Girl” fall in love
Guy discovers “girl” is really a guy
Guy 1 gets mad
Guy 2 shows love
Guy 1 and 2 pretend Guy 2 is really a girl  and stay together

That’s messed up.
