I'm a secretary, type 100wpm.  When I saw women being sexually harassed I spoke up and was blacklisted for it.  When Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon saw #metoo firsthand in Hollywood she said nothing.  She sees no injustice in my not being hired for office work.  Why?  #lesbian
Tomorrow! Come for the free breakfast, stay for conversation about how #MeToo is changing the places we work. https://t.co/dL7XtOEOTp
Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon is best summed up with one word: #crybully, or an oppressor who uses victimhood as a weapon predicated on the knowledge that her audience is too stupid to notice or too evil to care, kind of like her 30 year-silence or cluenessness aqbout #metoo.
I type 100wpm and live off YOUR tax dollars because #metoo predators want hot chicks in the office.  Why would a LESBIAN not speak up more loudly against sexualized hiring that causes it?  Teacher's pet @cynthianixon wants justice...for women...who already spend 86% of money.

Well, having people react to your opinion is a common result of saying words in public.

If #MeToo has been transformed into "mob rule" where are the victims of false accusations? The vast majority of powerful men who've been named have mumbled something or the other but MOST IMPORTANT, did not deny it. Most admitted to the behavior. This man probably harasses women. https://t.co/bP90gf81rF

STFU Terry Gilliam. HW took advantage of his position of power to sexually assault &amp; harass countless women. It wasn't us women "knowing what they were getting into".

Observation. As a whole, these accused perpetrators are not g*ds gift to women or men. That said, the #metoo #timesup movements have been doing a good job of sorting them out, the ripple effect making it easier for more victims to come forward. https://t.co/EfM8LFfIHo

Q5: Has the #MeToo movement opened more hiring opportunities for all genders or complicated the issue? #OMCchat https://t.co/aUlOVncfXa
A5: Men are discriminated against in hiring decisions in HR. Except for the top jobs held by men, most decisions are made by women who select in their own image. Is this a #MeToo issue? Probably not. #OMCchat
Q4: Do you believe companies have selected more women to interview because of #MeToo? #OMCchat https://t.co/srN6AZ9Xdj
People will naturally become defensive for controversial topics like #MeToo. We tend to think more emotionally and establish a firm position and opinion. I would say the discussion is similar to Politics: not work related and will only cause non-constructive arguments. #OMCchat

Objectively, the data does not suggest a shift in hiring trends. Subjectively, the #MeToo movement can evoke inherent sympathy to motivate hiring of a potentially affected, or in the future affected, individual who is unqualified #OMCchat

The saddest part of the Stormy Daniels interview, is that she felt that "she deserved" having to have sex with Trump because of her decisions that led her to his room.  Pressure sex is not consensual, @StormyDaniels. Keep being brave.

#StormyDanielsDay #MeToo
She clearly stated she does NOT feel like a victim and the sex was consensual even though she was not attracted to him. Did u even watch the interview? She's not aligning herself with the #metoo movement at all. #StormyDanielsDay https://t.co/HUejb6nwtH
Note to folks who are saying Stormy Daniels is #metoo: No. She isn't. She doesn't identify that way, and don't push her into your movement if she doesn't want to join. She has a solid sense of self-worth.
This doesn't sound like consent tbh #StormyDanielsDay #MeToo https://t.co/5C1x1Q1iDx
I appreciate Stormy Daniels not wanting to derail the #MeToo movement but her admitting she didn‚Äôt want to have sex with Trump and doing it anyways to be considered for a job is also a societal problem. Consensual or not. He used his position of power to influence her willingness
Has Obama taken credit for birthing the #MeToo movement?
 Because so many pedophiles and high ranking rapist scumbags were exposed under his watch.

#MeToo
I watched 60 mins with AC and Stormy Daniels. I found her to be credible. She separated herself from #MeToo movement because she said she‚Äôs not a victim.
"You didn't even buy me breakfast," @stormyDaniels owning @Andersoncooper who suggested she's lying abt Trump to get rich off of it. He slut-shamed &amp; victim-doubted her during 60 minutes interview. As Daniels explained, She's a victim of post affair intimidation, not #MeToo story
here's a casual promotion for something I'm doing: I hope people come to these events because they're for an important cause and we want to put Hartford on the map for continuing the wave of resistance started by #MeToo and #TimesUp. 1/2

One thing Stormy didn't realize, once she was threatened she was a #MeToo victim #StormyDaniels
Stormy may not want to align herself with the #MeToo movement, but sex with someone more powerful than you, who you don‚Äôt want to have sex with, because you feel like you put yourself in a bad position is the DEFINITION of the movement. #StormyDanielsDay

One thing that‚Äôs likely to hurt Trump more than anyone may see just yet is the pressuring her into sex. Whether she sees it, or herself as a victim, the resonance with #MeToo and #Weinstein will be impossible to avoid. #StormyDanielsDay #60Minutes
I didn‚Äôt really care about the #StormyDanielsDay until I heard she may have been threatened. I hope #MeToo rises up to support her bc if it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs the same classic intimidation technique sexual harassers &amp; abusers use to silence victims every single day.
Excuse me, yeah Hillary did her job getting off a child rapist and blamed the child 

It‚Äôs relevant because there was a news blackout on the story 

What happened to children‚Äôs rights, I guess you #metoo ppl only care about adults being groped for some attention https://t.co/BUrIT2CtID
Stormy maintains that this is not a #MeToo¬† moment and she‚Äôs not a victim, and that‚Äôs her right. But let‚Äôs not overlook that she forced herself to have sex when she didn‚Äôt want to, and felt she ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù it. 

It‚Äôs a scenario a lot of women have experienced. #StormySunday

Ew.  There should be violins playing during this #StormyDaniels interview on @60Minutes :   she claims it's not a #MeToo moment, then says she felt she had to bang Trump because it was her fault for making a "bad decision".
This is heartbreaking to read/hear. That she felt she had done it to herself &amp; couldn‚Äôt leave. #metoo https://t.co/zpiSbbpIVW
Stormy Daniels did a better job explaining why women put up with shitty behavior from men than 80% of #metoo stories managed to do

So #StormyDaniels wasn't attracted to Trump and didn't want to have sex with him. She felt like she couldn't say no or even ask him to use a condom. #MeToo is about a lot more than just physically being held down. It's about social expectations &amp; power dynamics. #60Minutes

If you say you believe in the #MeToo movement and think that women should not be allowed to carry firearm's for their own protection then you are a hypocrite.  If more women carried there would be fewer victims of sexual assault.
Organizational and corporate structural mechanisms are required to make meaningful and  long-lasting systemic changes in the workplace.

I'm a secretary, type 100wpm.  When I saw women being sexually harassed I spoke up and was blacklisted for it.  When Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon saw #metoo firsthand in Hollywood she said nothing.  She sees no injustice in my not being hired for office work.  Why?  #lesbian
Tomorrow! Come for the free breakfast, stay for conversation about how #MeToo is changing the places we work. https://t.co/dL7XtOEOTp
Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon is best summed up with one word: #crybully, or an oppressor who uses victimhood as a weapon predicated on the knowledge that her audience is too stupid to notice or too evil to care, kind of like her 30 year-silence or cluenessness aqbout #metoo.
I type 100wpm and live off YOUR tax dollars because #metoo predators want hot chicks in the office.  Why would a LESBIAN not speak up more loudly against sexualized hiring that causes it?  Teacher's pet @cynthianixon wants justice...for women...who already spend 86% of money.
