In #MeToo must note my first, worst abusers were the women in my formative years.

I'm a secretary, type 100wpm.  When I saw women being sexually harassed I spoke up and was blacklisted for it.  When Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon saw #metoo firsthand in Hollywood she said nothing.  She sees no injustice in my not being hired for office work.  Why?  #lesbian
Tomorrow! Come for the free breakfast, stay for conversation about how #MeToo is changing the places we work. https://t.co/dL7XtOEOTp
Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon is best summed up with one word: #crybully, or an oppressor who uses victimhood as a weapon predicated on the knowledge that her audience is too stupid to notice or too evil to care, kind of like her 30 year-silence or cluenessness aqbout #metoo.
I type 100wpm and live off YOUR tax dollars because #metoo predators want hot chicks in the office.  Why would a LESBIAN not speak up more loudly against sexualized hiring that causes it?  Teacher's pet @cynthianixon wants justice...for women...who already spend 86% of money.

I don't understand people who claim to support #MeToo talking about the "tragedy" of "ruined careers." Apparently this is the only situation in which men have no agency? It's actually the rare case in which men deserve all the credit: they ruined their careers all by themselves.

Since I called out terry Gilliam, only fair I call out Katy Perry. As much as I love her, her behavior on American idol was everything we're complaining ab men in power doing. She owes that boy an apology at minimum.  #metoo is not gender specific although the majority are women
Hey @verizonfios some feedback: your ad series with the Stranger Things kid in the time of #MeToo #TimesUp is embarrassingly tone deaf. The one thing worse than man-splaining to adult women is boy-splaining. Ugh.

Reporting #tip from @emilysteel when covering #MeToo: talk on the phone more so as not to create a record; keep your emails short &amp; sweet. Don't use hot-button words. #deadlineclub
Worst media coverage you've seen on #MeToo - The story that's missing! and when Legislation only addresses harassment when there's so much more. @mkotkin #deadlineclub
What have you learned in coverage of #MeToo?
It's important to not let political views blind your coverage, focus on accuracy, says @xan_desanctis.
@emilysteel says how much women's stories have been discounted and the importance of listening to women. 1/2 #deadlineclub

I think I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I am also part of the #metoo movement. I was sexually harassed by a woman I had class with.
Don't take this climate for granted to not report on certain things. Be aware of different class issues. #MeToo @Koalani
Interesting point from @mkotkin at #deadlineclub panel on #metoo reporting - whistleblowers are protected under the law for their contribution to public welfare but people who go public with sexual harassment claims are not
