Thanks, Barry - couldn't agree more. One of the more regrettable features of social media's reliance on 'memes' is how reductive it thereby becomes.

That women have 40-50% upper body strength of men, and 70-75% of lower makes men who enact violence against women all the more cowardly. Yes, women hit men. With a ratio much smaller than men who hit women. For those of you who think #MeToo is "mob rule", consider the FACTS.	-0.03841706036745406
