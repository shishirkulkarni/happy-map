So, now she's doubling down. I'm sorry, but the fact that some people titter over the name of an historic figure is no basis for altering a public memorial. That trivializes both our historical memory *and* the #MeToo movement. https://t.co/JEeGJSKzIc	-0.013300465116279058
So, uh, this seems to imply that the story Stormy Daniels has to tell involves sexual misconduct on Trump’s part, like that alleged by the other women who have accused him of inappropriate behavior.
