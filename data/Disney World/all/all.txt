Suddenly, I find myself in the situation where I might actually finally be going to Disney World this year??? But also we do one day of Wizarding World. Long Live Wizney World! We might actually be doing it this year. I'm crying.

My mom warned me to never read the horoscopes, or use psychic readings. So I never did. That's why I feel guilty about certain Disney movies (I'm still going to Disney World).

You allow spirits to attach to you when you dabble in divination. Obedience is better than sacrifice.
