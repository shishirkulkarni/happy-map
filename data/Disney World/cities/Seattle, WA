For a frozen head with no vocal cords, Walt Disney‚Äôs verse in ‚Äúit‚Äôs a small world‚Äù is fucking fire.
My life‚Äôs bucket list includes ‚Äúvisiting every Disney theme park in the world‚Äù if I visit Josh in Japan, but he‚Äôs not allowed to take a quick trip to Shanghai with me. On a scale of 1 to 10... should I buy new Mickey ears or wear what I already have?

Oh God. Flashbacks to Disney World, 1997. The "Honey, We Shrunk the Audience" show. Images of multiplying mice. Little puffs of air on audience members' legs that felt like those mice infesting the stands. The screaming. My God. The screaming. Mostly my own. https://t.co/CfN15Lrunq

Well, the only way to stop a bad Mickey Mouse with a gun...
