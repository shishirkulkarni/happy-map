Now what I think about the whole gun control debate, you see, you have the right to own a gun (If it's legally obtained). What people want is to make sure that some guns are not available to own (who needs a semi-auto weapon to begin with), and also to ensure that (2)

One day they're going to make a movie about the bravery and heroism @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 and the other Parkland survivors standing up for gun control are displaying now, and the @NRA and people attacking them will seem cartoonishly evil to the audience.
EVERYONE: @davidhogg111 &amp; I have a very serious disagreement over how to save lives. He favors gun control. I am totally opposed to it. That is POLICY. Do not get personal. Do not attack Mr. Hogg with profanity or call him a Nazi. He is not evil, just wrong. Stick to issues.
It's NOT a "gun ban." Que pasa, mijo??? It's GUN. CONTROL. Control does NOT equal BAN. It's making sure a crazy person doesn't get their hands on a gun. I know it scores you 'points' with your overlords, the NRA, but you're wrong! STOP. THE. BS! https://t.co/MfHqeajTWK

Yeah, the revolutionary at the forefront of the movement to liberate his country, who died lending his hands to the struggles of nations yet to be free; we should replace him with the high schooler who wants gun control in a racist ass settler state https://t.co/MHoHXAKCKs
The effectiveness of students protesting Vietnam led to the end of the draft in an effort to end protests over national aggression. Listening to Rick Santorum it’s more likely to see new legislation to outlaw protests for those under 21 than to any meaningful gun control.

Have Chicago’s gun control measures affected their crime rate at all? In fact, the most dangerous cities in America are run by Democrats. One of the lowest crime rates in America is in Kennesaw, Georgia. Where they actually require citizens to own a gun. And its not a small town.

YES. True gun control is part of a racial &amp; social justice framework.

Statistically proven that the better the gun control, the lower the suicide rate. 
In fact, women are 3x more likely to attempt suicide, but b/c men are more likely to attempt w/ a gun, they're more likely to succeed. 
Suicide is absolutely a gun control issue.

Gun control does nothing.  After seeing that ISIS attack in France,  that criminal got a gun somehow.  France has the toughest gun control laws and yet that happens.  People need to wake up.
I love weapons. I want weapons. I support gun control. Because I think it will give me less cause to feel I need weapons.

Rick Santorum - you can’t be serious. But then again, I guess you can be that stupid. You and your “colleagues” need to support gun control and not recommend that students learn CPR. How cavalier and dismissive you are of our new, next generation of activists who call out your BS

Being anti gun control bc you want to keep ur lil hobby isn’t an argument. No one is taking guns away from responsible people. Children are being murdered for just being at school. Grow a heart.
I love when right-wingers say we need to find "common ground" on guns. I think it's hard to find common ground when one side is saying "we need stricter gun legislation, even just a ban on AR-15" and the other is like "NO FUCK YOU GOVERNMENT CONTROL FREEDOM FREEDOM FREEDOM"

So what say we take all the board members of the NRA  and their spokespeople and place them in a school unarmed with active shooters at either end of the school for say 6.3 minutes and see if they are still anti gun control at the end

The areas with the harshest gun control laws have the highest gun violence incidents. 
This evidence clearly shows that gun control laws not only "do not" work but, are a Civil Rights Violation!

Theres a disconnect. Historically blacks have been denied access to guns to maintain the social order. Black communities have intense gun control already in place although blacks are the least likely to own a gun. Yet blacks are disproportionately killed from shootings every year
This week’s argument against gun control: because criminals determined to get guns &amp; commit murder will do so anyway, there’s no need to further regulate guns, because laws are only effective when 100% of the people abide by them 100% of the time.

Gun control means you aren't against  all guns but that you'd like some control over issues related to guns. Where are the hunters who can stand up and say no one wants to take my rifle for hunting? The name isn't anti-gun...
Great breakdown of why folks like me were not happy about those gun control policies proposed in The Guardian https://t.co/7uy0egnAnR
Supporting gun control equates to ALL guns taken away from ALL American people ?? Really now. This whole way of thinking is so ridiculous to me.
This thread is terrific, and worth checking out. (And sharing, and adding to, if you have some photos for it.)

Elected officials across the country, take heed, and pass gun control legislation accordingly.

the highest violent crime rates in the US are in the cities with the most gun control. the lowest violent crime rates are in cities with the least gun control. liberals can’t seem to get this through their head that gun control isn’t the answer
My humble answer to the marches in support of gun control.
The 2nd Amendment is what protects your right to protest.
If the 2nd falls all others will follow.
The right of freedom of speech would be next.

Its not like LGBT people could all start owning weapons to protect ourselves. Due to a myriad of social and environmental factors, rates of mental health issues in the LGBT community are higher. Guns are more often used in suicides than murders. This is why gun control is needed.
Want to know how conservatives have slot their minds, they think kids fighting for gun control is reminiscent of Nazi Germans; Trump wanted refugees from certain counties only, that’s cool though. https://t.co/BDB9PRpWng

If you think gun control isn't an LGBT rights issue, Id direct your attention to the Orlando nightclub shooting. Not only was what occurred a horrible tragedy and a terrible loss for friends and families, the fear that spread among the LGBT community was very palpable.

Jason Aldean says in EW interview that he doesn’t know much about politics or gun control but he does know that video games are too violent. He has a massive platform to actually say something and make a difference in America. It’s a shame.
There’s a meme (which has real punch) that inaction after Sandy Hook was proof nothing cd be done. In retrospect it broke a dam, allowed movement-building that was impossible when “gun control” was a taboo even for Democrats.
This Gun control is bull, don't believe it?? The reason ICES kills Christians is because they know they will not defend themselves with a gun or an AR-15.TAKE a good look at the situations instead of being afraid of guns yourselves!

If you'd have told me, back in 1984 when "Who's The Boss?" started, that I would like @Alyssa_Milano's tweet about gun control on a Saturday night in 2018, I would neither have understood or believed you.
Here's the thing:
Gun control is a complicated issue where no approach will be 100% ideal &amp; many people are oversimplifying it.
But if you mock kids who have been through a school shooting just for trying to effect SOME change that could prevent future such events?
You're a jerk.
What if I told you that before Wayne LaPierre took over, the NRA with a pro good-sense gun control legislation? What if I told you that the NRA used to be for training citizens to be responsible gun owners, and not protecting the "right" to purchase all guns at all cost?

I can almost understand the gun community being hostile or upset at the idea of gun control, but attacking a group like the Parkland Students who are just TEENS that personally experienced a senseless act of violence that could affect anyone at any time is extremely low.

These stricter gun control laws are actually making me sick. You can’t tell someone they can’t own a gun. Anyone can kill anyone any kind of way. I don’t care about you but my guns will be staying right here in my house.
nobody wants to take your rights away from you, you HILLBILLY. people just want a safer world where a 19 year old can’t buy a gun and KILL 17 kids in 6 minutes. anyone who doesn’t think we need gun control can take their guns and shove it up their ass https://t.co/sNvqSTEsjT
Our school has been through unspeakable tragedy. It is improper to now use this horrific event as an excuse to push gun control legislation that punishes law abiding gun owners. Instead, hold the cowards of Broward accountable, investigate the FBI, and enforce laws on the books

.@heyyallwtchthis Reasonable gun control laws... 
-No military style weapons
-No mags that can hold over 10 bullets
-24-48hr waiting period
-Mental health check (not a scan of past health issues)

Side note: I like that Richard Petty whiskey That's pretty cool
Saying gun control hurts our freedom is a false argument, @NRA . Gun laws don't hurt freedom any more than speed limits or seat belts. You still get to drive your car and have guns, we're just trying to save lives as you do

Gun control is a complex issue; I get that.

Folks who love guns outnumber those of us who don't; I get that, too.

Common sense gun control measures won't stop most of the violence we see or stop school shootings; that's true.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try it.
One of my friends on Facebook keeps posting pro gun control things and so I keep commenting using actual logic. He tells me to go away. How does that work? If you’re posting something publicly, you’re pretty much asking people to interact with your post 🤔

If the march organizers really cared about children, they'd be demanding armed security to protect them. But their goal is to punish &amp; disarm law abiding citizens.

I liked a @YouTube video https://t.co/R5wq9azCvG EPIC! Watch as Ted Nugent DESTROY Piers Morgan on Gun Control
people trying to use """bomb control""" as a means to ridicule gun control but the gag is....bombs are already illegal
Gun control gets the ratings so they talk about it, but its too polarizing to agree upon. Meanwhile, other protective measures for school safety are ignored and you know the rest of the story.

According to released audio from Broward County teachers, Biden is "dedicating his life" "to their cause." 

So that's what he's doing with the profits from the billion dollar China deal. Gun control.

Officials say the Austin bomber’s motives aren’t clear, but taking a wild guess here that he wasn’t a supporter of minority rights, universal healthcare, gun control
I’m sure #snowflake @OfficialJonZal will block me being the beta boy he is. No shocker that the left is minimizing the heroic actions of the resource officer. Apparently MD’s strict gun control laws were effective huh. #MDSCHOOLSHOOTING #GunReformNow #2ADefenders https://t.co/5Ktm6zZVm2
I really have yet to see great arguments for gun ownership. Ones without holes, ironically. Similarly have yet to see great arguments for complete gun control. Probably should seek a middle ground on this.

Quickest way to piss people off on here? Bring up gun control in any fashion. Watch the chaos ensue. No matter what your opinion is, there will be people ready to spit venom at you.
Gun “rights” activists are their own worst enemies. They talk about bombs knives Chicago never about what could be done ( except arming teachers) it’s great when they say their going to shoot democrats .. yeah that’s not an argument for gun control !

When will people understand a good guy w a gun is the only thing that stops a bad guy w a gun.  Not more "gun control".  Also if cops are the only good guys w guns then ppl need to realize they usually show up after the fact or after most damage has been done.  Don't be sheep.

How come all the firearm ignorant loud mouth anti gun agenda Dem/ Libs aren't front &amp; center whining about gun control after today's school shooting ? Maybe b/c the shooter used an "ASSAULT" pistol instead of an AR 15 ? #Tucker
The lack of coverage/discussion pertaining to the Maryland shooting and how it was handled, validates all arguments against increased “Gun Control”. I’m happy to see an argument fought with such conviction, yet little merit, diminish.
Poll: More want school security than gun control https://t.co/fDFuOcAMNG
For those of you unaware... there was a shooting at a Maryland school today. Mainstream media is not reporting it because 1. The shooter was 17, therefore had illegally obtained the firearm 2. Was stopped by an armed school officer. Both of these facts thwart gun control support
