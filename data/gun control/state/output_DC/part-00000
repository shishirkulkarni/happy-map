... Can any1 imagine the Patriots lending their team plan to pro-life protesters en route 2 DC 4 the March for Life? lol —that would be deemed “divisive” &amp; “political.” But    culturally, gun control &amp; vicious , assaults against 2nd-Amend. advocates R OK. https://t.co/Wn4khcToKk	-0.03677065868263472
...4) Efficacy/effectiveness. R children have been fed a leftist lie by their elders. Banning guns or so-called assault weapons will do absolutely nothing 2 stop or prevent mass shootings. This is demonstrably true &amp; will become more apparent w/gun control https://t.co/bcAShq3HbS	-0.034056752873563204
...5) Technological progress. With the internet of things fast becoming a reality, the day is not far off when people will be able to easily manufacturer their own weapons and bump stocks in their home. Gun control then will be truly be beside the point... https://t.co/0PqUucWu0K	-0.033237662337662316
...Big, practical obstacles to more gun control: 1) an armed citizenry who take their 2nd-Amend. rights seriously, understand he significance of those rights, &amp; R not about 2 melt away b/c of ostentatious displays of adolescent emotion... https://t.co/hk32ofRgdz	-0.03455566714490673
...Guns R so widespread that a determined killer will get a gun w/or w/out gun control. All the controls will do is inconvenience law-abiding citizens who threaten no1...  https://t.co/2vqkyYkBRV	-0.034056752873563204
...Moreover, facts R stubborn things. As people see/learn that banning guns doesn’t stop mass shootings; &amp; that the problem isn’t guns, but the lack of guns in the right hands, &amp; the failures of law enforcement, gun control will B seen as useless. https://t.co/NVWgOwZNAy	-0.03268084179970972
...So leftists &amp; “progressives“ should enjoy 2day, b/c their emotional high won’t last.
