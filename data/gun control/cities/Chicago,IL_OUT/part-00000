#MarchForOurLives @marchfolchi Don't ask for gun control you sheep, it won't happen w/ Trump &amp; NRA. Ask for ammo control, put a $1 tax on every bullet. Put a serial number on every bullet. There is NO REGULATION on ammo... attack ammo regulation, not guns.	-0.04105942307692306

#MarchForOurLives Current gun control proposals are worthless. 10 yrs after someone sells a gun to someone else, there is no paper trail. Ammo has no regulation. AT ALL. Guns are not registered anywhere. Gov only does background checks, they have no idea what gun you're buying	-0.040922813688212906

#MarchForOurLives brings tears to my eyes. I voted in 2016 based on who would take gun control reform serious. This has been at the very top of my list. It’s shameful it takes school after school to get shot up to finally get the ball rolling on this. #EnoughIsEnough	-0.039512331081081056
