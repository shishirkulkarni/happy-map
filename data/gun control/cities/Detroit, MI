Doesn't matter how many other rules you apply to guns. People will always find a way especially when their mind set is to kill. Watching everything upsets me cause our own government has gone as far as to set up school shootings to push for gun control.
I have one problem with everything going on in the world. We are being distracted and lied about the March. I understand no one deserves to die but how can you ask for change when there are already rules set. Gun control is a sham.

so students are marching for gun control but use signs with memes on them and expect adults to take them seriously?
The thing I don't get about the whole gun control debate is why we make such a big deal about guns, but nobody says anything about alcohol. There are way more people that die yearly from drunk driving compared to mass shootings, but nobody talks about banning alcohol

Most Americans are supportive of common sense gun control REGULATIONS.

People like to confuse Gun Control and taking all guns away, and making them the same. NOBODY is saying take ALL GUNS AWAY. There is absolutely NO good reason that someone needs to carry around an assault rifle.

Hey! Listen to these indoctrinated kids.. We need gun control, hey stupid teenager all crazy people kill in " gun free" zones!   Cities with strict gun laws have highest gun murder rates!
Watching this "march for our lives" and all I hear is "gun control" and "gun laws". No one is saying anything about the 1 thing the shooters had in common, they were all bullied. Where's the rally for that?

We're praying for those officers and their families

The only amendment from the Bill of Rights we've defended successfully is the 2nd, and that one, barely.

'34, '68, and' 86 gun control acts severely damaged the 2A.

Now the "Progressives" are progressively hammering the 1st Amendment.
