Gun control, but not ever at the expense of the further police militarization of black and brown communities. We know exactly where single-issue legislation leads in the carceral state.
Only way we get real gun control legislation is if we start actively arming minorities. No way Congress let's that happen.

The idea that gun control laws will decrease murder rates is completely naive. Criminals will still steal guns, buy them in black market, etc. A person who wants to kill will find a way to kill. There's an underlying problem here, and that's a social/psychological problem.

Here‚Äôs my two cents on gun control. If people aren‚Äôt following laws to begin with what‚Äôs a gun law going to do... I‚Äôm not blind to it. But the school shootings are done by someone who can‚Äôt buy a gun. A criminal isn‚Äôt going to follow the law so the gun can‚Äôt be tracked to them.

Marching outside holding up signs will not bring change. Gun control cannnot bring change. 

People who already illegally obtain firearms will not change their decsision to do harm to innocent people because a sign states ‚Äúno guns allowed‚Äù
furthermore, laying on the ground to symbolize dead kids isn‚Äôt activism. it‚Äôs grotesque. stop trying to profit off of the movement. if you‚Äôre for gun control, do something. don‚Äôt stand there. don‚Äôt lay there.

Those kids don't need any lessons on this. Strong gun control doesn't equal anyone's rights being violated or  nullified. The limits on the use of free speech don't nullify the 1st  amendment. By the same token, good gun control doesn't nullify the 2nd  amendment. https://t.co/cVdHHtB1T7

All the emotion and "intensity" and "power" of this movement is all based on the assumption that gun control WOULD have made a difference. A big assumption, and one that most on the other side seem to have no interest in actually debating. #MarchForOurLives

Do you realize millions of Americans want common sense gun control? https://t.co/drBgNiTyaC
Gun control is a very delicate topic. But in my eyes, we need more of it. We're going to need metal detectors, even trained good guys (not even necessarily with guns!), an easier process of taking away guns from people who have proven they can't be trusted with them and more

Despite what the NRA would have you believe, if you don't own military-style weapons, haven't been convicted of violent crimes, pass a background check, and aren't having a psychotic break, then most gun control advocates have no interest in taking away your guns. #factsnotfear
#MarchForOurLives As long as you agree with us, then the kids are sacred and untouchable, but if you disagree... What a joke! https://t.co/7kFXoreAvn

It's stupid that the man who stopped the school shooting is getting no praise. He stopped what could've been a massacre by using a gun. Gun control is understandable, a gun ban is unreasonable.

My 8yo's take on our trip to the NWI #MarchForOurLives rally: "People really care about gun control and make funny signs about it." :):):)
I marched FOR gun control, FOR my kids to be safe in school, FOR the ban of semi automatic weapons, FOR all of the lives lost to gun violence not to be in vain, FOR more resources and reinvestment into black and brown communities and so much more. You are not a good person. https://t.co/xr9nLULflk

That you keep calling it "gun ban" instead of "gun control/gun regulation" is literally the problem. Stop trying to delegitimize their cause with deliberately wrong phrasing. https://t.co/bLN19eerdm
‚ÄúSuperintendent Robert W.

It‚Äôs funny people would say it‚Äôs too early to talk about gun control each time a tragedy happened this time the victims voiced out and people judge them for speaking for gun control #MarchForOurLives

I have no idea how many thousands were out there with me. I kept thinking how did we get to this? We have really screwed up. Elected all the wrong people.

My two cents on gun control:

1. Yes, there need to be stricter gun control laws.
2. Stricter gun laws will not stop criminals from committing crimes with guns.
3. Guns don‚Äôt commit crimes, people do.
4. Reach out to those that don‚Äôt ‚Äúfit in.‚Äù Stand up for those that are bullied.

The lack of effective gun control is part of the reason -- one of many -- that so many unarmed men are shot by police. Any officer has to assume that anybody they see on the street may have a gun. Because they might.

Until we make our elections about the issues more important to us, such as gun control, nothing will change.

A few thoughts on the intra-left rift on gun control: I think a big part of the problem is "gun control" is a huge umbrella term. Pro arguments contain both bad liberal ideas (eg government watch lists) and good leftist ideas (eg disarm police).

Great Mills High School is not trending anymore. Why? Because a good guy with a gun prevented this from turning into a major tragedy. This is the real meaning of common sense gun control. I hope the people in the other schools around this nation are paying attention.

The shooting at Great Mills High School today was a teen dating violence shooting. The 17 year old shooter shot his 16 year old ex-girlfriend, and a 14 year old boy. Gun control is essential to save lives, and so is ending domestic violence. https://t.co/pexKrnpm9h
Aright kids, we gonna talk about gun control
Entrance control at schools with an armed guared with a trained dog is as close to 100% effective deterrance as you can get.  A dog is more effective, more sensitive, and less expensive then any technology we could use.  Nobody gets a gun past a dog.

In lue of the shooting today, I have heard many people say that Maryland has the strictest gun laws in the nation and therefore this couldn‚Äôt possible be a gun control issue. What they forget to include is that the bordering states (WV, VA, PA) have some of the weakest gun laws.

So I was driving behind this truck that had a bumper sticker that said, ‚ÄúGun Control: Hit your TARGET‚Äù which is all fine and dandy unless the gunman‚Äôs target is innocent people, but what‚Äôs even WORSE is that this truck went 10 mph below the speed limit the entire time üëç
How tf are people so dumb when it comes to gun control? One of my coworkers just brought up Chicago. I‚Äôm never talking politics with these people again.
Not this one either. When the statistics find that 88/100 people have a gun. When in a country with 300 million we have 270 million guns. You know we have a serious problem. Lawmakers need to man up and bring responsible gun control. Assault rifles at the very  least have to go. https://t.co/7XS9jZq5oB
