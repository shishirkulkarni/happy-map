I think the key to stopping future school shootings doesn't necessarily lie in gun control, it lies in educating children on mental health. How to manage their own emotions and use proper social skills. Also, educating them on cognitive disabilities and autism.

Breaking my silence about this whole gun issue: First of all, gun control will not stop people from getting guns quicker and or slower. Second of all, the entire issue of guns is the mental health crisis going on within our nation that needs to be addressed and spoken about.
If it did we wouldn‚Äôt have the second ammendmant, which is there too protect us in case our government uses weapons too submit power over the population. Ironic that at the same time we have issues with police and their weapons we are also dealing with gun control laws? https://t.co/DAPd2nkXjb

Okay, we're FOR gun control. We're FOR the "right to bear arms" being "well regulated," like the Second Amendment says. We're FOR not dying at school or work. We're FOR remembering that one of the inalienable rights is LIFE. https://t.co/HDGl8BJULF

Mindless 'March for Our Lives' gun control kids have bigger worries than guns https://t.co/Z5drDlxJj6     Youth is always wasted on the young ! Of course it is...
So let me get this straight..march for the cause of gun control but if a maniac with a gun shows up, you're  expecting someone with a gun to step in and handle the situation to stop the shooter...but you're  marching for those to be taken away. Very confusing stuff
If young people won't go out and vote for beer or cigarettes to be legal at 18 they will never vote for gun control either #marchforourlives
so students are marching for gun control but use signs with memes on them and expect adults to take them seriously?
The thing I don't get about the whole gun control debate is why we make such a big deal about guns, but nobody says anything about alcohol. There are way more people that die yearly from drunk driving compared to mass shootings, but nobody talks about banning alcohol

2018 - Millenials manage their dream of gun control
2019 - Trade war with China 
2020 - Liberal president selected, er, I mean "elected"

I am for some sort of reasonable gun control legislation. Although, I doubt it will do as much as folks think it will. 

Also, it‚Äôs not a sin if you disagee with me on public policy. It‚Äôs an opinion and a conscience issue.

In the American setting,

To understand gun control, follow the money.

To understand healthcare reform, follow the money.

To understand war, follow the money.

It's never in a business's interest to be regulated, forced to lower prices or be avoided.
Bc it doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda of media (gun control) so they don‚Äôt talk about it. A kid who illegally had a gun was killed by a man who legally had one. Doesn‚Äôt fit their story of guns are bad. https://t.co/GD1NOfZXHW

When will people understand a good guy w a gun is the only thing that stops a bad guy w a gun.  Not more "gun control".  Also if cops are the only good guys w guns then ppl need to realize they usually show up after the fact or after most damage has been done.  Don't be sheep.
