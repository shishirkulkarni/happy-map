What if the @NRA didn‚Äôt lobby politicians and members of the @GOP didn‚Äôt take that money? Instead they attack children and kids with a opposing view. They‚Äôd rather have their guns and, despite the increase school shootings, sacrifice more to gun deaths than stricter gun control. https://t.co/yhdPH5yRqi

For decades, the NRA has been happy to tar proponents of gun control with all manner of personal attacks, but today their proponents are lecturing others on reasonable dialogue? 

No. Hell no!

The Parkland survivor who‚Äôs advocating for the NRA and against gun control reminds me of Ron Silver in Blue Steel. Survives the same tragedy as the hero, becomes the villian.
Re March For Our Lives: 
a) There are already gun control measures legally in place. 
b) A TOTAL weapons ban wouldn't even "end" gun violence -- anymore than the War on Drugs has ended drug use. 
c) Putting kids on a political playing board is a scurvy way to push an agenda.
Why are you concerned about gun control when you really should thinking about the next rave day!!!!!!!!
If hundreds of thousands of people are marching for gun control what is the government doing? Does the government now work for the people or did that change also?
Now that gun control has been made into a left vs right issue, it's never going to get better. Divide and conquer. Politic$ has ruined this country. Get gun money and specifically the NRA out of Washington.

You want gun control? Go to your local gun range and get proper training, train your children and shootings will stop.
Btw recent statistics show shootings have been down the last 12 to 18 months.
The problem is simply misunderstood. It has nothing to do with gun control whatsoever. It has to do with children being raised in a Christian home and not talk the way of Jesus Christ. Weapons are not the issue. Children must be raised by mother and father and taught about Jesus https://t.co/Vsf8Bg5Em9
