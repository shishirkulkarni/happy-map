For the Republicans who don't want any gun control and say, "why blame it on the gun, blame it on the individual" we should be asking them why there are any laws about drug usage. Should let the individual decide.
The gun control kids mean well, but there's nothing revolutionary about their movement-- they're pro-cops, pro-military, pro-Bipartisanship, etc., essentially just advocates of the current liberal order, and that's why they muster such broad support; they change nothing

I hate guns and don‚Äôt believe they should be out there, but as long as the government wants to control things they will always make things 100% worse for poc and make things easier for white people, gun control can only hurt poc and give them less rights than the white man
A bunch of amazing kids are giving Democrats everywhere a lesson on how to shift the Overton window on guns.

I have a practical gun control suggestion that does not require Congress: schools should create and circulate lists of which homes have guns. I never knowingly let my kids go to a home with a gun. Lots of people feel the same.  It's social pressure, stigma. #MarchForOurLives
Most people who have such a hard on for gun control have actually no idea about half of the current laws for guns or even how guns work.

It‚Äôs actually really annoying. Although I believe certain things could be changed, banning guns makes absolutely no sense at all.

You can disagree with @KillerMike but it's important that we don't censor or block out opinions. No matter how much I care about gun control I still think it's important that we hear different viewpoints, that's how we progress as a country, by listening.

Let's make sure this massive showing of bodies across the country to protest the lack of gun control doesn't stop here.  Follow up.  With more demonstrations, more voices, more news events, more exposures, more pressure, more voting.  More voting. More fucking voting.
The NRA has no one to blame for this but themselves.  They didn't have to fight every single gun control measure but they did - while the bodies piled up.  Now they're up against a predictable and overwhelming backlash they can't control.  #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/6XmQ5aBjfZ

A few thoughts on the Tyronn Lue news today:

1) Like gun control, I think it's OK to talk about Lue's performance after news of a tragedy.
2) I dislike Lue's performance.

4) Drew may be worse.
