poll/ 69% of Americans support tougher gun control laws, up from 55% when the question was first asked in October of 2013. While 60% believe that making it harder to legally obtain a gun would result in fewer mass shootings, only 42% expect elected officials to take action. (AP)

It's like somebody collated the worst liberal gun control ideas. It's practically a doomsday scenario.
Here‚Äôs one of those GOP princes...He seems to be offended that Parkland students are asking legislators to take action to protect them in their schools. Learn CPR because the GOP is too scared of the NRA to protect our children.

EVERYONE: @davidhogg111 &amp; I have a very serious disagreement over how to save lives. He favors gun control. I am totally opposed to it. That is POLICY. Do not get personal. Do not attack Mr. Hogg with profanity or call him a Nazi. He is not evil, just wrong. Stick to issues.
It's NOT a "gun ban." Que pasa, mijo??? It's GUN. CONTROL. Control does NOT equal BAN. It's making sure a crazy person doesn't get their hands on a gun. I know it scores you 'points' with your overlords, the NRA, but you're wrong! STOP. THE. BS! https://t.co/MfHqeajTWK

You are making my argument back to me. WE NEED GUN CONTROL. They were showing that the gun laws gave white people with guns total power over them because of racism.

Statistically proven that the better the gun control, the lower the suicide rate. 
In fact, women are 3x more likely to attempt suicide, but b/c men are more likely to attempt w/ a gun, they're more likely to succeed. 
Suicide is absolutely a gun control issue.

Gun control does nothing.  After seeing that ISIS attack in France,  that criminal got a gun somehow.  France has the toughest gun control laws and yet that happens.  People need to wake up.

you're 100% right and I wish I made this clearer in my original tweet: gun control legislation that targets mentally ill people will only further stigmatize mental illness and won't protect anyone https://t.co/zSbEMjexrh
media has provided this stigma that America has a gun problem- when in reality.... we don‚Äôt &amp; the moment you ask for ‚Äúreform‚Äù is the moment you allow government to have more control over everything when u can simply just go &amp; buy a knife from Walmart &amp; stab 20 people
My favorite thing about the whole Astroturfed push for Gun Control is all the ‚ÄòWoke‚Äô people who were telling us minorities are being oppressed by militarized police departments, but are now advocating for only Law Enforcement and the Military to have guns.
‚ÄúAnd whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth me.‚Äù Matthew 18:5

Theres a disconnect. Historically blacks have been denied access to guns to maintain the social order. Black communities have intense gun control already in place although blacks are the least likely to own a gun. Yet blacks are disproportionately killed from shootings every year
This week‚Äôs argument against gun control: because criminals determined to get guns &amp; commit murder will do so anyway, there‚Äôs no need to further regulate guns, because laws are only effective when 100% of the people abide by them 100% of the time.

the highest violent crime rates in the US are in the cities with the most gun control. the lowest violent crime rates are in cities with the least gun control. liberals can‚Äôt seem to get this through their head that gun control isn‚Äôt the answer
My humble answer to the marches in support of gun control.
The 2nd Amendment is what protects your right to protest.
If the 2nd falls all others will follow.
The right of freedom of speech would be next.

Its not like LGBT people could all start owning weapons to protect ourselves. Due to a myriad of social and environmental factors, rates of mental health issues in the LGBT community are higher. Guns are more often used in suicides than murders. This is why gun control is needed.

Me regretting not marching for gun control today
If you mention gun reform or bring up gun control and someone immediately claims you want to ban all guns or take away their guns or eliminate the 2nd amendment, that person is not worth talking to. They are the problem.

I love my guns. But I don‚Äôt understand why so many others who love their guns are under the impression that ‚Äúgun control = no guns‚Äù
It‚Äôs a strategic mistake to blame and attack ‚Äúgun culture‚Äù for gun homicides and suicides. We who want gun control need to isolate the minority of gun nuts packing AR-15s and handguns from the sport hunters. ‚ÄúGun culture‚Äù agglomerates them all together.
a million kids in Washington asking for help on gun control so Mr Trump flys to Florida,,,,,,,God forbid he makes his @FOXNEWS base upset caring about those 17yr old commies
With marches happening in cities all around the nation, it is undeniable that gun control is on the mind of America. #marchforourlives https://t.co/ivePATcD6b

Teachers should get raises not guns. Students shouldn't have to go to school everyday with the fear of being gunned down. Lawmakers need to create better gun control, because a new wave of voters are coming! #MarchForOurLives #neveragain #LetsGoGenZs #November https://t.co/hx8L0Hel2x
These kids are very, very smart: "People always say, 'Get off your phones,' but social media is our weapon. Without it, the movement wouldn't have spread this fast." - Jaclyn Corin, aged 17

I was proud to join the March for Our Lives in Harrisburg today. Students across the country are demanding to be safe in their schools and in their classrooms. This seems like such a reasonable demand, but time and time again we have seen congress fail to act on gun control. https://t.co/IP0WyYnnmq

Although I aggressively disagree with Killer Mike going on NRATV,honestly speaking Bernie doesn‚Äôt have the best record on gun control. https://t.co/PlFn6U1GdH
White people are silly. They marched to stages full of them saying they‚Äôve had enough and blaming gun control for white men being white men, all while crying. It was interesting to observe. https://t.co/nvw9qEYYR1

We need gun control.

We need Capitol Hill to give a shit about these innocent children being killed and enforce laws that actually DO SOMETHING.

We need our voices to be heard.

I went to #MarchForOurLives today, &amp; it was so powerful. My peers &amp; I have given Congress an ultimatum. If nothing changes regarding the gun control in America within a month, we‚Äôre coming back, 20x harder. https://t.co/SmTENftgtS
To everyone posting counter protest pics of people with "criminals love gun control" signs. Send me one of you with the same sign. When the next mass shooting comes around, I'll be sure to post it back on your page for you as a reminder. #realworld #guncontrol #yourewelcome
Does gun control protect the lives of black and brown folks? https://t.co/lCGf6hrcm6
Alright y‚Äôall I‚Äôm just mad upset about this and need to get it off my chest. America is anti-black and that‚Äôs just tea. As much as I love the entire March for our lives campaign and gun control I really don‚Äôt want to be seeing white kids in black panther outfits..
I hope this path to gun control reform includes police officers and the guns they use to senselessly murder black and brown lives day in and day out without any kind of justice. #justsayin

So sorry that happened to you. So brave of you to speak out and share your tragedy to help gun control https://t.co/GCEahW4Ixa
Hey dipshits.

I‚Äôm concerned we need to march to implore the US Gov to introduce better gun control laws to stop innocent children being murdered.

I‚Äôm not concerned that one observational joke about the obesity epidemic in the US offended your selective overt-PC ethos.

Go blog.

Why Gun Control is important- A Thread‚ú®üëèüèª‚úäüèª https://t.co/iSKu44jvKu
If you'd have told me, back in 1984 when "Who's The Boss?" started, that I would like @Alyssa_Milano's tweet about gun control on a Saturday night in 2018, I would neither have understood or believed you.
Here's the thing:
Gun control is a complicated issue where no approach will be 100% ideal &amp; many people are oversimplifying it.
But if you mock kids who have been through a school shooting just for trying to effect SOME change that could prevent future such events?
You're a jerk.
What if I told you that before Wayne LaPierre took over, the NRA with a pro good-sense gun control legislation? What if I told you that the NRA used to be for training citizens to be responsible gun owners, and not protecting the "right" to purchase all guns at all cost?
Whatever your view is on gun control at least stick to your guns !

This is a very important video to watch when looking at the gun control debate. The NRA is NOT a public interest group , like the ACLU or NAACP (as they claim to be),but an industry lobbying group whose only job is protecting their product https://t.co/uUwkWCS02o
