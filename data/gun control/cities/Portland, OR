Gun control = don't sell to mentally ill or diverse citizens such as criminals..well duh
Gun control is not taking away the guns, it's controlling how they are sold, how many, age restrictions, mental health restrictions, and other things.  We will always have guns.
And Republicans do not think we need much stronger Gun Control laws????
