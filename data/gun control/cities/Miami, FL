So many people are jumping on the gun control bandwagon. That‚Äôs good but no good will come out of a gun grab. It will lead to war and many people will die. You must choose a side.

Don't be fooled into thinking those on the left "just want justice." They don't just want "common sense gun measures." They want the little bit you're willing to offer in gun control measures, and then the rest as well, including taking ALL guns. They'd shank you in a moment.
The "gun control" movement isn't 100% bad. I'm sure there are a few merely misguided people who think they're calling for something that makes sense, but they're wrong. 99.99% of the gun control movement is aimed at taking your freedom away, which is evil, don't trivialize that.
We can't seem to agree on what "sensible gun control is" but I like your moxie, kid.  Spend the money you'll waste on chasing the gun control ghost and spend it on school security personnel + tech.  The money IS there.  #atleastyoutried #MarchForOurLives

When the left can‚Äôt use tragedies as a means to push their agenda for gun control, they claim white supremacy and use race to divide more. Nice.  #AustinBombings

Democrats basically need to run moderate candidates that are pro gun, anti abortion, anti illegal immigration, and would support Trump's economic vision to win back control of the House of Reps.... Meaning they would have to not be Democrats.

Today makes 31 days since the massacre in Parkland.

The NRA &amp; GOP were counting on us moving on by now.

Collective amnesia until next time, when they would again say,

"Thoughts and prayers.. Now is not the time to talk about gun control."

The "gun control" movement isn't 100% bad. I'm sure there are a few merely misguided people who think they're calling for something that makes sense, but they're wrong. 99.99% of the gun control movement is aimed at taking your freedom away, which is evil, don't trivialize that.
Don't be fooled into thinking those on the left "just want justice." They don't just want "common sense gun measures." They want the little bit you're willing to offer in gun control measures, and then the rest as well, including taking ALL guns. They'd shank you in a moment.
