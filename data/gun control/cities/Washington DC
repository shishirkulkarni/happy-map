Theres a disconnect. Historically blacks have been denied access to guns to maintain the social order. Black communities have intense gun control already in place although blacks are the least likely to own a gun. Yet blacks are disproportionately killed from shootings every year
Until the old guard in Congress &amp; Senate are Gone, will gun control taken seriously. They will NOTHING, but thanks you kids had a good walk.

A 30 billion dollar a year gun industry will not just roll over in the US. If the dems/republicans can they will make it into a conglomerate business model and control the numbers from DC. Nothing changes it just rearranges to bolster the rich.

I‚Äôm fine if all gun owners have the same requirements.
It's funny how there are tons of guns brought into America everyday illeagly but yet gun control is going to help that. Right?  Just like the war on drugs stopped the drug problem. It's not going to work cause it's already easier to get a gun illeagly then to buy one leagly.

If we think the ban on weapons would stop at just AR-15s, we are fooling ourselves. That would be just the beginning. Yet not one person has justified how gun control would prevent another Parkland. It would not. Legislation requires justification, not because it feels good.

Let's get this straight before it gets conflated. Killer Mike had really good points. The one thing we forget when we talk about gun control is how many ppl, especially PoC use guns as a defense. But using assault weapons or shilling for the NRA are where I draw the line.

The tricky part about gun politics is convincing the pro gun side that gun control isn‚Äôt a black and white issue. I support gun control- that doesn‚Äôt mean I support a full scale weapons ban. The NRA isn‚Äôt an accurate reflection of gun owners and that creates misunderstandings.
The irony of a lot of #Yall Hot takes on gun ownership:
1. Most of y'all ain't even discussing the same type of guns.
2. Most of y'all don't have any historical knowledge about the relationship between Black people and gun control laws.

The vast majority of gun owners support stricter gun control laws.
Even one-third of NRA members want to ban assault-style weapons.

If you are still arguing AGAINST gun control, please explain:  https://t.co/NJKn0OKxGW
The current form of Gun Control that exist in the US is completely focused around a narrative that "Black people are dangerous &amp; don't need weapons). One of the ways to fix that issue is fact checking that narrative.
I know the #MarchForOurLivesDC was about gun control. What I also notice: the biggest restaurant line was @HipCityVeg. Gen Z are not only coming for the guns, they‚Äôre coming for the meat industry

The end of this can‚Äôt be just gun control, it has to also be about preventing extremist groups from seizing government. We don‚Äôt have gun control because of the NRA, they exist because our society has been hijacked to value profit before life. That‚Äôs the root. #MarchForOurLives

As far as gun control goes this zero tolerance attitude is completely necessary to create any form of change. It‚Äôs enough to scare the money out of politicians pockets and that‚Äôs what matters in completely pay to win system.
I think one of the major issues  besides gun control is that these young kids are the future of America and the much older politicians who control this country are having a hard time accepting that truth. #MarchForOurLives

Today is the day of students protesting the

A protest fueled by misguided lefty agendas.  
What we need is control unstable people's access 
to guns by enforcing laws already in the books! 
Unfortunately the folks in charge not take them 
seriously.
No. The idea is for reasonable and sane gun control laws. But if making guns anathema is the only way to reduce deaths from gun violence, you will only have your own intransigence to blame. #MarchforOurLives

The problem with gun control isn't those who legally own them, its the gangster and the underground you need to take the guns away from. I don't see that happening unfortunately.
At the March- gun control sanity! https://t.co/Q8b91bhBTO

Is March for our Lives a march for stricter gun control or a march against gun violence?
I find it interesting when veterans who support gun control are vaulted into almost celebrity status are lauded, and considered extremely credible on the subject. Yet when the solid majority of vets, esp combat arms vets, support the #2A and are vocal about it... crickets....
If you want to actually support the Parkland students‚Äô cause as opposed to just getting good PR for your team, then stop giving money to candidates who routinely block any effort to pass common sense gun control.

Existing gun control law doesn't give Trump the power to ban bump-stocks.

The NRA knows this which is why they're not saying a word about Trump's action. They'll quietly sue when the rule's finalized... and Trump will shrug.

Been listening to the students about gun control. They say what went wrong. Well they took prayer out of the schools, the SWAT out of the schools, told the kids to call the police on your parents if we give you a SWAT or whipping and used violent games as a babysitter. Wow
Needless to say, another lie. The ATF found that bump stocks were a "firearm part" and thus not subject to regulation as a firearm under the Gun Control or National Firearms Acts. In other words, under law Obama Admin wasn't permitted to prohibit them.

Sick of MSM treating Parkland students like they are heroes b/c they organized a march. Students' safety may not be a partisan issue, but gun control is. And let's not pretend the March for Our Lives isn't just a pro-gun control march disguised as an anti-violence march.

if your argument is that kids who are too young to buy guns or non-gun owners can't have a say in gun control, then:

- non-retired people can't speak about pensions or social security
- men can't speak about abortions
- straight people can't speak about LGBT issues
Instead on being focused on gun control we should be focused on what is happening to our kids. What has enabled them to become so desensitized to human respect. Maybe we should look at what they fill their mind with!  Violent video games, violent movies, no father in home etc

Read the full text of of HB1465 Illinois Gun Control. no semi-auto pistol that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine of more than 5 rounds of ammunition. Question- So 1 in chamber, 5 in magazine is ok? OR 1 in chamber 4 in magazine?  Calling every gun "assault weapon".

Each new mass shooting only provides an utterly terrible reminder of just how much inaction there has been on gun control in this country. They will let their own children DIE rather than stop taking that NRA money.

Think of all the things people want in gun control, licenses/safety courses etc, that‚Äôs what you need to get a handgun in Maryland, a person with a handgun shot up a school this morning‚Ä¶
This is why we need stronger gun control laws, including ones that make careless parents complicit in murder for leaving out guns where children can find them. https://t.co/FBzfATY1O3

almost a week ago they marched for gun control and now they were affected by the awful act of shooting.
i am extremely sorry to Great Mills High School.
I shouldn‚Äôt be scared to go to school , I SHOULDNT. Go to school knowing that it could be my last day . We go to learn not to have people get hurt because we can‚Äôt have better gun control . where is the action huh?
This is far too common on both sides, and it makes me sad. Some #2A advocates can‚Äôt get past ‚Äúcrisis actors‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoros!‚Äù just like gun control advocates can‚Äôt get past ‚ÄúNRA!‚Äù and ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt care about children‚Äù to have a meaningful conversation. https://t.co/k55VIO7mH6

ANOTHER school shooting. But we don‚Äôt need gun control. Or reform on outdated laws. Or an age limit to purchase. According to what, the NRA and many government officials these kids are just mentally ill. Nothing to bat an eye at. Nothing proposed to address the so-called issue.

another shooting at a school &amp; the older generations are still bashing us on our beliefs of gun control- they think we‚Äôre too young to have a say in politics and laws. 

we are also too young to die from those who have easy access to guns

Heartbroken over the news of another school shooting. Students and teachers should not have to fear for their safety. No matter where you stand on the gun control issue, we must do more to prevent these senseless acts of gun violence.
Will @fox5dc use their 1st amendment "news" platform responsibly and push for investigation of root causes of school violence, (ALL VIOLENCE)? Or will they continue to push the #SchoolShooting narrative to achieve Dems "gun control" while promoting #MarchForOurLives this weekend?
