Grammar, middle, and high school student safety needs are once again lost in an argument over gun control. As the old Covey quote so wonderfully stated: “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.”
Dear gun control/reform/violence activists,
Maybe - just maybe - pushing for a debate on the 'Repeal the Second Amendment' article is our best tactic to achieving lasting #CommonSenseGunLaws .
It might move the Overton window in our favor. Think!

There is little you can say about why gun control theoretically wouldn't work that doesn't apply 10 fold to why drug control doesn't work.
The truth is exactly the opposite. To be pragmatic about gun control, we should focus on the 99% of gun control laws that Heller would permit -- not the 1% of gun control laws that Heller would forbid. https://t.co/AMtxtm8jis

At least 1 out of 3 Americans are known to own guns.  The unknown is even larger.  That's the upside of all this outcry for "more" gun control.  You're not a criminal if you own a gun .... yet ..... be proud that you do.  You may be the single line of defense for someone someday.
Also, I'd just like to say that just because I do not support the gun control movements does not mean I have no sympathy for the Parkland kids. Of course it was a terrible thing, but that doesn't mean all of a sudden they know everything about everything.

Almost all of @PAHouseGOP supported that pro-NRA bill (some Dems did too!). @Jsantora5228 voted for it. @RepCharlton voted for it. @nickmiccarelli voted for it.  @parep160 (Barrar) voted for it. 

That bill did nothing but make gun control more difficult to achieve.

Statistically proven that the better the gun control, the lower the suicide rate. 
In fact, women are 3x more likely to attempt suicide, but b/c men are more likely to attempt w/ a gun, they're more likely to succeed. 
Suicide is absolutely a gun control issue.

EVERY TIME I post about gun control, I get between 1 and 3 white guys that defend guns, and want to 'correct me' on my information. EVERY. TIME. Only white dudes. But the gun issue is about protection and not white supremacy right?
The gun control is not the answer because that would only stop good people the honest people from getting guns because they won't break the law , but if you have and agenda or some kind of mental problem you will get what you want done also what about other forms of weapon
Gun control does nothing.  After seeing that ISIS attack in France,  that criminal got a gun somehow.  France has the toughest gun control laws and yet that happens.  People need to wake up.

These anti-gun liberals think gun control works? It only regulates LEGAL gun sales. So you want to cut down on non-criminals with guns? Outlaw the Gangs and close the boarders with a wall if you want to stop illegal gun sales.
no one should ever think that disgusting newt ever had any human decency. utterly despicable person. gun control is not anti-2a. attacking a rally about giving our kids a safe place to learn is utterly despicable.

My favorite thing about the whole Astroturfed push for Gun Control is all the ‘Woke’ people who were telling us minorities are being oppressed by militarized police departments, but are now advocating for only Law Enforcement and the Military to have guns.

What’s up with people fearing gun control? Oh... they realize they are probably the ones unfit to have a gun and won’t be allowed. Got it.
Hope something good comes from This March , remember it takes both sides to come to an agreement for common sense , Not just gun control but view all possibilities to make schools safer!

It’s a mistake to exclude suicide prevention from the gun control conversation. It is also a massive error to state that means restrictions do not work for those struggling with thoughts of suicide.  The research shows otherwise, but you fail to include that.

By insisting 'gun control' means 'banning all guns,' the @NRA is effectively losing control of the narrative. All these years they should have been advocating for gun rights with age limits, background checks, and registration.

It occurs to me that police departments across the country should want to support gun control. If guns are harder to obtain, it might be harder to think every black man with a wallet or cellphone in his hand is about to shoot them.

Alrighty everyone let’s talk about gun control! (Fun right) Anyways I think that while it is to easy to get guns, I do NOT think we should ban them all togather. Drugs are illegal, people still have them. Same with guns I think. We just need tighter control of distribution.
If I polled the people marching asking what they mean by "sensible" gun control there would far less consensus. #MarchForOurLives

The 2nd Amendment is what protects your right to protest.
If the 2nd falls all others will follow.
The right of freedom of speech would be next.

Its not like LGBT people could all start owning weapons to protect ourselves. Due to a myriad of social and environmental factors, rates of mental health issues in the LGBT community are higher. Guns are more often used in suicides than murders. This is why gun control is needed.

I love my guns. But I don’t understand why so many others who love their guns are under the impression that “gun control = no guns”
It’s a strategic mistake to blame and attack “gun culture” for gun homicides and suicides. We who want gun control need to isolate the minority of gun nuts packing AR-15s and handguns from the sport hunters. “Gun culture” agglomerates them all together.
All this talk about voting out politicians that don’t do more on gun control. How about voting them out anyway? 30yrs as a politician is enough.

I don't understand the people who don't understand that Gun Control doesn't mean taking away the guns &amp; getting rid of the 2nd amendment. Virtually no one wants that to happen, especially the people marching today: they just want common-sense gun legislation that can save lives.
It’s incredible to see countries like Australia &amp; England stand in solidarity with America on gun control. Our elected officials make fools of the US on a daily basis sometimes directly attacking them. But they are willing to look past that &amp; see the humanity.

Does anyone else find it interesting that there's a world wide March asking for the United States federal government to institute more stringent gun control on its citizenry? Some of these countries get upset when the US tries to tell them how to live.
if your gun control doesn't include disarming the police then you're being tricked and your fear taken advantage of

The best way to combat this Liberal-Socialist Gun Control BS.... BUY MORE GUNS!
Obama was in office for 8 years &amp; I believe he was a DEMOCRAT &amp; he did nothing about gun control? Blaming the GOP for lack of gun control is I don't know..like blaming the NRA for shooting 17 kids in class? It was a great liberal agenda but next week we blame Planned Parenthood😎 https://t.co/er1yKnIP9t

Unalienable Rights:Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. All are precious, no doubt, but so are the civil rights that insure the unalienable rights. Rights that are made unalienable by that association. The 2A is second with good reason. Gun control is an infringement #ICallBS

I liked a @YouTube video https://t.co/qr2IntuES9 How the NRA hijacks gun control debates
It is really going to be something when we start to see republicans talk about gun control once the money and votes shift the other way.
Trump...NRA will never get you re-elected now.. they’ve lost footing-it’s simple math. Do the right thing for gun control
Gun control coming, yo. https://t.co/fS9hD1h0mc
Activists are marching, but the public hasn't punished GOP in polls for inaction on guns

https://t.co/nk3bD6i1iN
The “people die in car accidents so should we just ban all cars?” is an awful argument against gun control. 

It would go like this “people still die in car accidents so we shouldn’t make manufacturers install air bags and seat belts”

Sounds a lot worse now right?
I refuse to take advice from a group that struggles to put their dirty clothes in the hamper.

Honestly thinking about gun control and it’s sad that a lot of my peers felt that WE should be doing more on our side to keep ourselves safe. Bullet proofing doors and walls or cameras and more locked doors and more armed physically fit personnel.
It’s pretty eerie when you hear a 12-year old scream “What do we want - GUN CONTROL - When do we want it - Now!” This is a gun issue.  This is a mental health issue. This is a safety issue.

I wish the #MarchForOurLives folks would have just a little intellectual honesty and admit it's a gun control march. Which won't help. What WILL help is to address mental health problems. Sane people don't find a weapon (gun, bomb, knife) and want to kill. They just don't.

Oh really? Let Hollywood stars tell you about gun control while they’re being led to the march with armed security. Who’s gonna protect you? I’ll wait ....
President Trump recently fed the nation a bunch of promises about gun control he quickly reneged after feeding the NRA dinner.
I should hope these Brave Young People do what the GOP is unwilling to do: HOLD THEM ALL ACCOUNTABLE.

Why didn’t all these kids march for gun control the past few years while Chicago’s (or many other big cities like Philly) gun violence has been off the charts?! 🤔
Answer: because it didn’t affect them. #hypocrites
"Dear #GOP, we don't want your thoughts and prayers. We never did. It's meaningless and disingenuous. How about instead you cooperate with the Democrats and work on gun control?"

Few people want to take guns from you. They want responsible gun control that calls for age restrictions, background checks, a waiting period, and a ban on assault-type weapons. Keep fighting things that 70% of America wants. eventually, there will be a ban on all weapons.
In addition to fighting for #GunReform today, young people across America are also highlighting how important it is for everyone turning 18 to #RegisterToVote. Be the change you want to see! #NeverAgain #Marchforourlives https://t.co/1an0d9xVhl

#MarchForOurLives It will happen again &amp; again. NO gun control or laws will prevent this until the USA abolishes The Second Amendment.
Be careful , Resisters. The GOP is already  hyping "all we've done in the last few weeks regarding gun control." They want you to think they're moving forward so you'll get complacent. They're not going to release their NRA $$$ until we "pry them from their cold dead hands."
"The political action part of it is my grieving process. And the amazing amount of support just shows me that I'm not alone."

The common ground is common sense gun control that preserves people’s 2A rights while keeping guns from those who shouldn’t have them, &amp; keeps certain types of unnecessary dangerous weapons out of civilians’ hands.

You’re obeying your NRA bosses at the expense of the people. https://t.co/ZQJN2YWHBh
#Pennsylvania The gun control rally is absolutely ridiculous. Our constitution gives us the right to bare arms. Take away the guns from the good people, the bad guys will take over. How are we suppose to protect ourselves if someone breaks in or if the government takes over.
Major gun control laws prolly won't be a thing so everybody just get a strap and call it a day

My feed (well the political half of it) is so confusing. It’s half conservative and half liberal because of the peeps I follow. one tweet is about how all liberals are crazed SJWs or something and the one below is screeching about gun control or impeaching trump. It’s amusing
The gun control convo gets a little tricky when you consider the fact that it’s not a comprehensive proposal to demilitarize the police force as well. 

Taking guns out of civilian’s hands but leaving them in cops hands implicitly means you trust cops to use guns wisely.

Here's the deal, I'm not against gun safety, I am against gun control, I don't own any guns, nor do I want to, but the 2nd Amendment gives us the right to bear arms...if a criminal wants a gun, he will get one by any means necessary, regardless of if guns are illegal or not

One thing on Killer Mike: So, I love him. Always have and always will. I don't mind him not being as enthusiastic about gun control as we are. However, I wish he would not appear in NRA videos. They are using him. The NRA is a death cult that makes money off of dead children.
Jose lives in Washington, D.C. "The whole grip of the NRA on the government is disgusting," he says. "If we can grant D.C. statehood, that's two more votes for gun control… Those of us who live here, we gave up our votes to live here." #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/nHj8uHxQ6q

GUN CONTROL= NO SECOND AMENDMENT.
My definition of "sensible gun control". All of you gun control posing pussies give all your guns to the adults who don't use the word "tran" when describing themselves to their liberal friends, and we won't shoot you, we'll protect you, and you can use any bathroom you want. Ok?
The main problem with the argument against gun control is tons of empirical evidence. That's it though
If “Conservatives” aren’t Reactionaries after seeing this astro-turfed Gun Control movement put together and supported by Billionaires, the Media, Hollywood, &amp; Academia (who brainwashes kids), then I don’t know what will.

And the defiant fake profile globalist wannabe would lead you to believe that these fine folks are marching for gun control. They aren't.

One really insidious thing about this tweet is the "common ground" part. Fact is gun control supporters have been trying to find common ground for many years and @NRA and their lackeys flat-out refused. They refuse now too. There is no common ground anymore.

The Democrats have more messaging energy from traditionally secondary topics like policies for the poor, race relations and income distribution. Even though the midterm elections are eight months out, gun control could become a strong new message by November.

Couldn't be more proud to march alongside @NYAGV1 and the thousands of New York students demanding meaningful action on gun control. The gun lobby has never faced opponents like these. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/ijoPO3DdrG

They can keep blaming citizens with legal guns, but change to gun control laws will do little, if anything. Psych drugs/mental disorders, gun-free zones. lack of metal detectors, unresponsive PD and FBI, and hide in place-bunch up policies. https://t.co/KiyLzcSyS2
One takeaway from #MarchForOurLives  is that advocates for strong gun regulations are no longer willing to compromise. After years of hearing hard Nos from @NRA, gun control supporters are going with Plan B: secure political power and force their agenda down throats of opponents.

Thank you to all the marchers out there today kicking ass for sensible gun control. #GOP, Be Afraid. Very afraid. https://t.co/zln21j9w4V
The NRA and gun control opponents are calling what happened in MD a win. A win that the shooter was able to get into the school, with a gun that should have never been in his hands, and was able to MURDER the person he wanted to shoot-his ex-girlfriend.
We see you. We salute you. All the young people leading the way and taking their futures in their own hands today, you are our example. #MarchForOurLives #Enough https://t.co/ZTe3Hxz6jb

When you say you’re pro 2nd Amendment as if the gun control advocates aren’t, it’s like, if people want food regulations so people don’t die from food poisoning, you say “I don’t want regulations, I’m pro-food”. Doesn’t make much sense. #MarchForOurLives
Ask yourself "Who is funding and organizing the gun control protests?" I'd really like to know. #2ADefenders

How clear it is that @realdonaldtrump is such a worthless coward along with his wife #Melania. They had to flee Washington rather than confront and welcome the millions marching to demand gun control.  This #family is a disgrace. They are American #traitors--not American
“We deserve to live a life without fear of being gunned down...its time to care about all communities equally,” Trevon Bosley, from Chicago, who lost his brother Terrell Bosley to gun violence a decade ago. His family has been advocating for gun control all that time. https://t.co/4c1eMNMOgN

So many people are talking about gun control, (and I get that), but why isn’t there any talk about metal detectors at school doors? What about more officers on campus? We need better safety in our schools; not just weapons being taken out of the picture.
Anybody have eyes on this talent show? (which reportedly is the reason today's rally in DC isn't on the national mall)

If you think marching for gun control is anti-2nd Amendment, you’ve been purposely lied to. If you think the 2nd allows you to have any gun you want, you’ve been lied to. #MarchForOurLives

I hope Washington is hearing these wonderful young adults. They are registering and will be voting. Look at how many people are marching for gun control. There will be a record number of people voting. So watch out, Here they come!
First they didn’t think a group of women of color could organize the latest global protest march. But they did it. 

Then, they didn’t think a group of students could organize a nationwide student protest for gun control. But they’re doing it. 

What what happens next.
NEVER AGAIN? 

Beware of any politician that agrees with a dictator!

Nazi Germany established gun control in 1938 &amp; from 1939 to 1945, Millions of Jews &amp; others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up &amp; exterminated.

Gun control only means to penalize law abiding citizens!
Bad guys don’t care about law!
Is that hard to understand?

@ananavarro @Rosie @Emma4Change I’m leaving shortly.
I think if these young adults, in the wake of a tragedy, can channel their grief to push for gun control, the least we can do is show up and MARCH.
Cheers, hats off and full support to everyone marching in today’s gun control events! #marchforourlives
Enough. https://t.co/GDJqYFMXfJ
Trump leaves Washington before StudentMarch on Gun Control. Out of respect, he should have remained but par for the course (no pun intended) he decided Golf more important. He just does what he wants so far without consequences, but that will change with Mr. Mueller on his trail!

My thoughts on gun control. Even though we have the rights to bare arms,  its the fact of making sure guns don't fall onto the wrong hands. This is why gun laws are put in place. But its even more Valiant to have security as well. We do not secure enough in America today.

Many investments directly support gun manufacturers and retailers — here's how to figure out whether yours do https://t.co/7IbZ1fywH3 via @businessinsider
Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. The manufacturer told the ATF in 2010 the product was "intended to assist persons whose hands have limited mobility." The ATF determined it was a "firearm part" and thus could not regulate it under the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act. https://t.co/duoKLyvCiX
I was in high school during Columbine. These ‘kids’ put us to shame. I was skeptical "these kids" could inspire America to take gun control seriously. After all, the same was said of the LGBTQ community after Pulse. I was wrong to doubt them. https://t.co/MfhodeEh1u

Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.

Obama tried for gun control but the GOP pushed back every time

Gun control nuts' response to Austin bombings: "See, bombs are illegal, and we still had a bombing. Therefore, no gun control." Roughly, if making something illegal doesn't bring its incidence down to zero, it should be legal. This would not pass muster in a kindergarten.

4. A good guy with a gun stopped him.

These are the reasons why the MSM refuses to give it any attention - it DESTROYS their anti-gun narrative.

Another shooting in a school in Maryland today. When is this going to end? And this is exactly why I’m marching on Saturday. We have to speak up about more gun control. This isn’t normal

Here is a suggestion, march inside your own state try to get your changes within your own state. Look Rick Scott did sign some moderate gun control and he is getting heat from the HRA.  Florida is being sued by NRA for raising the age to 21 to buy a assault rifle.
Gun control will only disarm law abiding citizens, criminals will always find ways to get guns because they naturally like to break the rules.

Donald Trump and other republicans only support one bill and it is a bill to basically strengthen the existing background check system it is the weakest gun control bill you can possibly support. Donald will only do what the NRA allows him to do.
