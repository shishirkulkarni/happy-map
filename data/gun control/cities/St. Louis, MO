These liberals will NOT stop until parents start suing these school districts. What does a 5 yr old know about gun control? Dems are lower than low. Using babies to push their misguided agenda.

If I was one of these parents? I would SUE the school district. https://t.co/bexsDvG3UL

Probably the former, since I still don‚Äôt know what you are talking about.  I‚Äôm getting on a plane now.  The offer stands.  Name any gun control law you want, and we have tried it somewhere in the U.S.  I may be bad at Twitter, but I do know gun rights and laws  üòâ https://t.co/M8IuWvBOdT

I will never concede to more gun control.  The places that have it like Chicago don't control the guns.  They control the innocent.  The criminals don't care about your feelings or your laws.  They will use any method available to instill fear and get what they want.  #Support2A

When people start figuring out the the Deep State is DELIBERATELY using mentally ill people to either do mass shootings or take the fall, they'll be much better equipped in "gun control" debates, and put the blame where it belongs: on globalist conspirators #MAGA #QAnon https://t.co/4yPRlgNxru

Pope Francis says you‚Äôre NOT Christian if you support gun manufactures.  Did you fail to discuss your gun control issues with him?
Feeling good today. My NRA, AR-15 toting neighbor listened to my thoughts on banning weapons of war, universal background checks and other common sense gun control views. He is dropping his NRA membership and agrees weapons of war must be banned! He‚Äôll be joining the march
Dems and their memos. Latest one to FBI deleted 1/2  millionpeople, with warrants, from the NICS database. This means they can buy guns. Why would Obama and the DOJ do that if they are serious about gun control? 45, get these people back on the list now!!!!
So, this article makes the point that pushing restrictions on gun rights is a political loser.  See Congress in 1994, after they passed the Clinton Gun Ban. The Dems lost control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Bill Clinton credited the gun ban for the loss. https://t.co/LdNsr3USgH

Liberals don't apply the value of life to unborn children but will say if getting gun control just saves one child it's worth it.  They want it both ways.  Tired of the hypocrisy. It's all good though.  I don't take much stock in liberals views.
