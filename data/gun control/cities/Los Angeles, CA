Not yet sure how many ppl this affected, but FBI suggesting that failed background checks declined by 80% after the change. So while Dems,leftist,students,libs call for gun control-(abolish 2A) it was OBAMA who made it easier for criminals 2 buy &amp; continue 2 buy guns!

The 2nd amendment protects your right to own a gun, not ammunition. So, @WarrenBuffett @BillGates @JeffBezos please purchase every ammunition manufacturer and pull a @martinshkreli on bullets. See @chrisrock "Bullet Control." #MarchForOurLives #ammunitionreform #bulletcontrol
Mass shootings are horrific. But the issue of gun violence is so much bigger than that. My perspective on gun control was shaped by this community and their voices need to be heard. https://t.co/aoij7xsh8u

üá∫üá∏ is the largest arms maker &amp; dealer around the world. Our Corps &amp; Govt have us believing these are separate issues, they‚Äôre not. We‚Äôve got to think bigger... like disarming our Feds, Military &amp; Police FIRST.
I've long been aware of Jesse Hughes' right-wing views and left it at "agree to disagree" but this is where me and EODM part ways. Fight gun control all you want, Jesse, but don't level personal attacks against children who survived a mass shooting. https://t.co/V6iv9BmnYz

I've never feared a law abiding American with a gun. I've feared criminals with them. Stealing law abiding Americans's guns using the ruse of reducing crime is akin to taking cars to prevent drunk driving. No gun control law has ever caused criminals to surrender their guns.

Rick Santorum suggested students learn CPR *instead* of advocating for gun control? Learning CPR is always great, but how long does he think it takes? It's a one-day class to get certified, like 6 hours max.
I think that  is way better than more Gun control laws. Less legislation more solution. https://t.co/4pk3dRKB3Z
Hitler wanted gun control, Liberals want gun control. Hitler imposed censorship. Liberals want censorship imposed. Liberals aren't fighting Nazis, they are the Nazis. No wonder they are so angry.
Is it me, or are people protesting with the wrong items on their protest agenda? Gun control won't solve "crazy", and this problem isn't resolved with an elimination of the 2nd Amendment,  but with law enforcement not ignoring the obvious, and with ppl and politcians paying attn.
"The hypocrisy of the march employing armed guards at the anti-gun march" says a person who has absolutely no idea what gun control actually is.
I love that the crazy, gun loving right wingers are screaming that teenagers are not mature enough to talk about gun control, at the same time that they are screaming that you can't raise the age limit to buy guns to 21, because teenagers are totally mature enough to own guns.

Trump: always tweets out of his ass
Also Trump: remains quiet after the march for students‚Äô lives and gun control
69% of Americans are in favor of gun control. The number will grow. As a high school student said before being suspended from school, to Congress: "When will you get off your fucking dead asses, and do something!". I concur. https://t.co/qN5W1gfN0o
We need gun control because students should not have to worry about a school shooter while taking finals.
I already responded but I have another thought! üôÑ There have always been single-issue 2nd A voters. Now there may be single-issue gun control voters in the hundreds of thousands where there were none before now. What do you think? https://t.co/WMKx2IJWkT
March for Our Lives Gun Control March Long Beach https://t.co/Z7PaRZVAiI via @gruniongazette
If you think the march today was to  ‚Äúban‚Äù guns, you weren‚Äôt listening, (again)‚Äîshocker. It was to enact sensible gun control, which protects 2nd amendment but provides reasonable controls to limit, (but sadly, not end), events like Parkland. https://t.co/1O4z7EaV3F

So uhhh. What happens when an illegally acquired gun is used to shoot up another school? Where did that ‚Äúgun control‚Äù get you? Guns don‚Äôt kill people. People kill people. The root of this is issue is that we‚Äôre raising a bunch of pussies.

Want gun control? Impeach. Trump.
Listening to the NRA about gun control is like listening to Ronald McDonald about childhood obesity.
New AP poll: 90% of Democrats, 54% of gun owners and 50% of Republicans now favor stricter gun control laws. Will it motive voters? Republicans need to be defeated in Nov. And the Blue Dog/DCCC Democrats who are allied with the NRA need to be beaten in primaries

I wonder how many of these gun control activist, tag alongs and limelight seekers are going to pay money to watch a movie this weekend featuring their hero actors shooting it up, selling drugs, glorifying gangs and sexing it up...?
The fact there were no major gun control marches during the Obama administration when over 17,500 people were shot in Chicago and 4,000 killed makes me think today's #March4OurLives has very little to do with gun control.
The stupidity involved with not being able to differentiate between ‚Äúwe need better gun control‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want the government to ban guns entirely‚Äù explains why Trump was elected.
Gun Control is a touchy issue to talk about, but only cowards shy away from tough discussions.

It is sad to see gun control advocates, celebrities and people of wealth use a horrific event and the innocent faces of our children to further a political agenda regarding gun control.  To plan, finance and use them as an activist to support their cause, is concerning and wrong.
The @NRA is an organization filled with vile, selfish monsters. That they are even a part of the conversation on gun control is a joke. The marches today are a beautiful, glowing testament to the fact that these awful people support a dying cause. Their days are numbered. https://t.co/HP9GmmxMSP

But on a real note gun control proposals must must must must must include the police bruh. If anything disarming the police should be top priority, then the residents.

Yo. I Love KillerMike but I'm incredibly dissapointes with his statements today. The March for Our Lives outcry is for for control not the elimination of gun ownership. Twisting a message meant to protect folks that look like you is foolish.

If you're thinking about gun control today, please also think about police violence, Alex S. Vitale wrote an essential book last year about the need to end policing as we know it. https://t.co/fKfjSdxkXk
"After the Florida shooting, Hoffman, a former ambassador to Portugal, told GOP leaders that he would¬†not make any more contributions unless they passed a ban on assault weapons."

When comes to serious matters like gun control, thoughts and prayers are not enough! https://t.co/VdClClyPRS
PalmerReport: Fro_Wundas SchMieke ChrisMosser Killer Mike gave a friendly interview to the NRA. That means he's aligned with the NRA's stance against any form of gun control, and he's aligned with the NRA's attacks on these Stoneman Douglas kids. You can't get any lower.
We stand with the students, parents, partners and allies today marching! Such a powerful show of support today for proactive gun control. #studentsmatter #tellyourstory #whyimarch #advocacymarketing #activateforla #Regrann @esperanzacommunityhousing -  P‚Ä¶ https://t.co/uY1IlFzLsA https://t.co/InCUpQ5WJb

I think gun control is the only issue people won't consider unless you can show that it will prevent 100% of shootings from happening. Ridiculous.

To me, this is an example of making signs to delight fellow protesters, not to change anyone's mind.  The folks fighting gun control are the survival-of-the-fittest crowd who think kids with deadly peanut allergies should "toughen up" or else are "defective" and too weak to live. https://t.co/IU4lODanKE
