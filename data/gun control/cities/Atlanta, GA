Genuine question, asking somewhat neutrally: why is there fierce opposition to stricter gun control laws? No one is proposing to strip everyone of their firearms but simply to ban/limit sales of assault-style rifles. Can we blame kids for wanting change after all these shootings?

When opponents of gun control claim to be defending 2A, everyone takes them at face value. Why? They also say they'd use force against a gov't taking their guns (i.e. they'd take up arms against any gov't that legally removed 2A). That makes them pro-guns, not pro-Constitution.

I feel like there is nothing wrong with gun control laws as long as we are still able to protect ourselves. I don‚Äôt think I need an AK for somebody trying to attack me around town
can't in good conscience address gun control when the government has been caught doing secret experiments on ppl mind control and probably is still doing this. What ppl who are real need to do is ask the mass shooters that are alive if they feel they were victims of mind control
Love the turnout globally. To any gun nut, GOP, anti-gun-control legislators, NRA supporter, or GOA supporter - F you! The terrorist organizations NRA &amp; GOA, cause of more American deaths than foreign terrorism since 2001, will be destroyed one day. @NRA #MarchforOurLives

I always thought two things were missing in the gun control movement: the salience and the votes. It seems more people are mobilizing on this issue alone to offset NRA's endowment.

But it needs the votes. The current party in power has clearly communicated where it stands.
"We are the change." Students flood streets across the United States to press for more gun control. Read more of @AP's #MarchForOurLives coverage here: https://t.co/1ms7zrqAt9. https://t.co/MOailS6zeR

It's really something, as a mentally ill person and thus subject to more violence than the average person, to have to tune out the fight for gun control so you don't see all the people throwing you under the bus.

National gun control rallies subversive in nature disguised as a movement to protect students by disarming you. Protect students &amp; citizens both... dont "tread on us".

The difficult issue of gun control is how to implement it without adversely affecting vulnerable ppl, esp. the mentally ill and PoC. As such, it'll probably have to avoid criminal penalties through outright bans and instead incentivize people to give up guns voluntarily.

If you listen closely to some of the people who lost folks in the Parkland shooting you can tell that some politics is creeping in.  Particularly the parents. Those that keep saying "school safety" are ignoring the mass shootings in malls and offices. Gun control addresses all.
Gun owners should be required to have liability insurance.  I recommend $500,000 per firearm. That is a starting point for common sense gun control. Next how about taxing bullets...a lot. #ParklandStudentsSpeak #GunControlNow #stoptheinsanity

One person killed, and one seriously injured in ISIS attack at a French Market. But wait..... I thought France was a Gun Free zone. I mean they're one of the strictest countries when it comes to gun control. Guns aren't supposed to be in a gun free zone.

Another school shooting üòû. Sad the country starting to normalize this and not do anything about gun control
your president will not pass gun control and betsy devos will not fund the arming of public schools. the rep. agenda is to defund education and push anyone who can afford private schooling out, making pub ed. a welfare program (1/2)
Gun control must seem like a logical solution to someone who thinks nobody under 21 drinks alcohol, nobody outside of Colorado smokes weed, everyone abides by the law, and Buddy the Elf is our President.
Not having kids because I would hate to send them to school only for them to experience a school shooting since the @GOP and those sick fucks at the @NRA will do everything under the sun to keep gun control from happening.
Another school shooting and some will still argue that gun control is not going to be the solution.
