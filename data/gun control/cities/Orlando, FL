Man white people on Facebook get so pressed when you talk about gun control... like, sure buddy, guns are more important than people‚Äôs lives.
Gun control does not mean to Repeal the Second Amendment.

Making sure you don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbomb‚Äù or ‚Äúthis place will explode‚Äù inside an airport or airplane is in fact, not banning the First Amendment.

Just like any other laws, our Constitution must be regulated to ensure safety.

Looking at Rep/Dem Gubernatorial candidates for Florida. Dems want strict gun control. Won‚Äôt endorse them. Republicans against female, lgbt rights. Won‚Äôt endorse them. What‚Äôs a person to do. Who‚Äôs the Independent? What‚Äôs he/she want?
....example. Gun rights were taken years ago. Now, a social media post that the State doesn't like will get you put in jail...literally. No joke, it's happening regularly. Once a government gets the taste of ultimate control, taking away a civil right, it will take them all...
To all those saying gun control violates the 2nd amendment, the amendment has the phrase ‚Äúwell regulated‚Äù in it. Guns were intended to be regulated by the constitution you claim to hold near and dear. #MarchForOurLives

Gun control is a theory, no guns equates to no more mass killings or even gun crime. 300 million guns in the hands of Americans is a fact that equates to the protection of freedom and liberty from government tyranny.

LBR. Gun control didn't become a problem until white kids started dying.
It's good that Black Americans are against liberal gun control, however part of the Omnibus bill gave authorities the right to take guns from Americans without due process.

Total moron. Its the reverse. And if you delete the 5 major Dem controlled cities with strictest gun control, the US has one of the lowest gun murder rates in world. Mia has very low IQ. https://t.co/uzk8KT8hmY
Like I said, if the right was correct in claiming the left is hiding its true intentions of repealing the 2ndA, if I were the right I would enact fair gun control to make any push for a repeal seem unreasonable. Would kill the gun control momentum.

#livepd Can we get this guy's thoughts on gun control
My new favorite thing is my mom reading comments on a Facebook video of the #MarchForOurLives &amp; loudly proclaiming, ‚ÄúNO ONE IS TAKING AWAY ALL YOUR GUNS. ITS ABOUT GUN CONTROL UGH‚Äù. Same mom, same.
If I was president I'd pass whatever gun control law you want as long as it was passed with tougher laws to cut down on distracted drivers.
You know I've figured out that most people arguing for stricter gun control don't know the difference between automatic and semi automatic guns, and also have never owned a gun and had to go through the process of getting an extensive background check to own a gun legally
I just got a sponsored ad tweet from somebody who described themselves as a "classical liberal" in their bio; the tweet said "Always remember, the ultimate goal of gun control is to leave you defenseless."

How the hell did I get that as a sponsored ad given everything I tweet?

FIRST THEY WANTED PROTECTION THEN THEY WANTED GUN CONTROL NEXT THEY WANTED ALL GUNS THEN THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF THE ROTC PROGRAMS. THEN THREATS TO TAKE OVER AND CONTROL. GENERATIONS HAVE DIED TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS WE MUST STAND STRONG OR THEY DIED FOR NOTHING. üôèüá∫üá∏

Sir, did you really just use Chicago as an example of gun control related issue? (Speaking on Fox news) Perfect example of how more restrictions do not work. You took the oath to support and defend the Constitution....do it! @SenatorDurbin
Who Was Marjory Stoneman Douglas?

Gun control. My neighbor is Homeland Security. Every 3-4yrs I get a visit from an investigator checking him out make he's not a nut case or that he's not a threat, etc. Our government does that for employees that carry firearms Y not do that for all people that want to buy a GUN?

The Womens March which co-sponsored the student gun control walkout protest is all actually backed by George Soros with his latest $246M donation to activate the group. His $$ buys most anything! A true Patriot will send him running!
Ok, everyone is calling for walkout for gun control this and that. I'm calling for a day of students doing what they're supposed to in school, purple being kind to each other, people helping each other, you know... What humans are meant to do
