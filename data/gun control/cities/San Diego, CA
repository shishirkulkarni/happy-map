We need gun control within our own police department https://t.co/koNYaVFWxA
Gun Control includes the Police. All these Liberal shits don't care that the police are killing people of colour. I'm anti gun control because we need guns to kill both the liberals and the police. We need guns for the revolution my comrades.
We should all be ‚Äúanti-homeless‚Äù being homeless is a terrible thing. Instead of funding giant marchs against gun control, why don‚Äôt we help the homeless ?
We cannot and will never repeal the Second Amendment. The only Amendment that was ever repealed was the 18th which prohibited alcohol. Amendments serve to expand our rights‚Äînot limit them. We can have commonsense gun control while still defending our Constitution.
Gun control also includes POC who've been murdered by cops!! This is insane. #BLM https://t.co/ekTuZ4varx

I believe in gun control. I think guns should be licensed like cars: you literally have to take a test, carry insurance, manufacturers liable for defect/inadequate safety features, &amp;c.

Unpopular opinion: It is possible to be both pro-gun and pro-gun control. As a gun owner with a clean background &amp; sound mind, why would I be against legislation that has no effect on me whatsoever but has the potential to keep guns out of the hands of those who pose a threat?
How many times does it have to be said??? These amazing kids are fighting for gun CONTROL! The only people who are saying gun ban are uninformed nut jobs
I have listened to @adamcarolla since I was 15 years old starting with Loveline on KROQ, the morning show, and onto the podcast. I was able to over look the breaking up of episodes so they could play more ads and the clean shows, but the hypocrisy of his views on gun control...
Even in places with rational gun control it takes an ongoing effort to reduce the number of unlicensed guns and ensure every gun owner is safe and qualified. Thank you #OPP https://t.co/PX4QqNnnwD
I disagree. Note the 2nd Amendment includes "regulated" which implies regulation of guns IS allowed. ü§î Why haven't gun control advocates seased on that? https://t.co/WrRGHUc3zU
We don't want to repeal the Second Amendment. Stop being ridiculous. Doing that is both impossible and unnecessary. It was already decided in Heller that gun control is constitutional.
all i want for 2018 is a massive turnout at the voting booth.  If People want change VOTE.  Pick a stance and vote it. Be it Gun Control or Choice. Pick a topic and hold M'Fer's accountable.  If not we go back to the future.

Psychopathic murderers support gun control. Psychopaths fear death, yet they will mete it out when it suits them. They seek vulnerable &amp; defenseless prey. Hogg supports gun control. Therefore, Hogg supports murderers.  Is Hogg the best leftists could dredge?
Better background checks 4 gun control is GREAT, but how did this become Trump's fault as our president? So are  YOU liberals saying there was NEVER a mass shooting or school shooting when Obama was president &amp; what did Obama ever do to fix anything except his golf game?

Donald Trump decided to run off to Mar-a-Lago. This is unacceptable. He believes that teachers should carry guns and when students protest for gun control he runs off. I wonder if the NRA ran off also or maybe they are counter protesting.
I know quite a lot of people who own guns. None of them think about murdering people. However, I do think this march is good but in a state with already strict gun control? It doesn't make sense.

The reason Donald Trump is not doing a damn thing about gun control is because look at the dumbasses that got him into presidency. Step down as President Mr. Trump. You are not fit for being our president. You are not hearing the voices of the people.
It's not an issue of gun control. It's an issue of a lack of virtue in society. If you want to change that, getting rid of God in society will (and does) pose a problem. The more virtuous a society becomes, the less violent it becomes.

This is true, but:

We already have tough firearm restrictions in California and I don't think we need to go any further. California is not safe with "common sense gun control" and America would be hurt if we followed my states lead.
And let's be honest....#NeverAgain is a ridiculous slogan.  You could slap major gun control restrictions on the people and there will still be shootings at schools and public places.  Let's at least be logical.  We give these shootings so much attention! That's what kids want.

It's #March4OurLives today and time to talk about gun control. While the NRA is most often blamed for failures to enact reasonable gun control, there is another group that bears a lot of responsibility. It's time to talk about white Evangelicals and Guns.

We support you and we believe you are our future. STOP
GUN VIOLENCE NOW.! Vote these politicians out of office America! There is no excuse for not passing gun control legislation in our country. Who runs this nation? Citizens or NRA?
I'm all for reasonable gun control laws but that still feels like a band-aid. How can we address a problem closer to the root when it comes to school shootings: kids resorting to gun violence in the first place?

Gun control interesting concept
My take on gun control: well guns don‚Äôt kill people, people pulling the trigger kill people. However, I still believe in stricter gun laws. I would love to get rid of the 2nd Amendment. We don‚Äôt live by 17-1800‚Äôs standards anymore. Weak people fight with guns. Guns down, ü•ä on.
I am a firm believer in keeping the message simple - here is one for 2018' GUN CONTROL - run on that shit - Be specific not vague - single message - weapons of WAR off the Street - other arms are fine - force GOP to buck NRA -

Can you see it in this picture?

Yet another demonstration how the most ignorant people on the subject of firearms tend to be the loudest calling for gun control.  I'm not sure how that can ever end well for anyone.

The 2nd amendment 200+ years ago. Update this to reflect the changes in weapons over the years. We have certain limits on free speech, no reason to not have smarter gun control!

I really wish there was more gun control, as in you still get guns but they are more controlled, in the past there was a temporary ban and when it lifted mass massacres spiked by like over 120%, people are so ducking annoying with how bad they want guns, and if that‚Äôs how it is

Realized I included St. Patrick in tomorrow‚Äôs service (make me a channel of your peace) completely accidentally. Sermon will be about gun control. The song just seemed right. #StPaddysDay #serendipity
So instead of gun control we have to have "hardened" schools, malls, churches, theaters, concert venues, clubs, bars, work places...sounds more like prison or war. Way to make America a great big pit of anxiety and terror. #GOPFail https://t.co/DsXXosZLpW

Is there any school district in the US that would openly support an organized walk out and protest about abortion the way they did with gun control this week?
