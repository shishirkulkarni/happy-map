Snowflake Fox Host Whines About Student Gun Control March And Pimps For The NRA (VIDEO) https://t.co/VHAkZnJLP4 #Getwoke #MarchforOurLives #Politics	-0.04971493775933607
So @marklevinshow is running with the "since there are other ways to kill people other than using guns we should do nothing about gun control" argument. That logic is insulting to us logical thinkers.	-0.05019381720430105
So HEY, let’s read about gun control as it pertains to suicide deaths. ⬇️ https://t.co/dM8AIUhUIx	-0.04909346879535558
So I (along with everyone else) is disappointed in Killer Mike for appearing in an NRA video. Let's talk about the segment of the left that raises (somewhat) valid concerns about the liberal push for gun control (which I unequivocally support, BTW)	-0.04969538866930168
So I do not understand the kids these days. They are fighting for gun control without knowing anything about the argument deciding if guns should be banned or not. Most of them are just followers of people they think are correct instead of thinking themselves	-0.0690702040816326
So I’m gonna talk about gun control now. 	-0.05009055232558134
So basically the biggest opposition to gun control is the NRA preying on the Rambo fantasies of gun owning Americans...	-0.07634999999999995
So being critical of who theyre targetting in their proposal for gun control is cancelling them..? God forbid we teach the youth not to push the blame on minorities https://t.co/rxPxvMSuV5	-0.05524545454545456
So done with the weak arguments (i.e. NRA talking points) against gun control. This whole Parkland Shooting, Drumpf's un-Christian-like behavior while so-called Christian leaders praise him, the debt and deficit...and the die-hards who refuse to see the impending recession. https://t.co/HJf1PhJ8ff	-0.04983367139959432
So great to see hundreds of thousands of students protesting in the #MarchForOurLives. This is what real democracy looks like. 	-0.0515296202531645
So impressed at @TeenVogue taking on and explicating so many current issues-Now on #GunReformNow THIS is such a powerful article and addresses so much of WHAT IS right now and WHAT TO DO going forward. Does @Emma4Change ever sleep??! https://t.co/olZaW1NfDy	-0.05571277533039647
So many white people erroneously think the Parkland kids began a gun control movement from scratch.	-0.05461987951807226
So much for @Delta’s neutral stance on gun control. So glad we opted to fly another airline to Italy....  https://t.co/8faAuaMI8l	-0.04656434782608695

So much healthier &amp; more democratic than the billionaire-donor-dominated, top-down, warped charade that Washington has become. 	-0.0515296202531645
So oooo #Pennsylvania GOP Sen. #RickSantorum suggested that instead of protesting gun control legislation students should be taking CPR classes and preparing for active shooter scenarios.	-0.04909346879535558
So proud of all the young people. Make a difference for sensible Gun Control. ENOUGH is ENOUGH	-0.04993861985472152
So proud of these young people from all backgrounds, working together to affect legislation on gun control: https://t.co/1gehVzljwb	-0.05040685279187816
So sorry that happened to you. So brave of you to speak out and share your tragedy to help gun control https://t.co/GCEahW4Ixa	-0.04608828402366858
So the students marching for gun control are "Hitler Youth"? I thought Hitler armed everybody who could serve in his military, and ordered them to attack the rest of the world.	-0.04977312661498708
So to be clear you’re bitter cause kids are quoting a few historic protests to object against our country’s recurring gun issue? They’re protesting gun control to benefit EVERYONE and you’re sick cause they didn’t come up with an original hashtag? Cause that’s what really matters https://t.co/aLrYsfP5bz	-0.04532863534675613
So us law abiding citizens give up our rights to owning a gun. No problem. 	-0.048816049382716054
So what say we take all the board members of the NRA  and their spokespeople and place them in a school unarmed with active shooters at either end of the school for say 6.3 minutes and see if they are still anti gun control at the end	-0.04864325452016688
So what the fuck is Gun Control if you’re not controlling the police guns 🤔	-0.050193584379358384
So who is going to shoot the little white kids killing motherfuckers up in these schools? Even with gun control I’m sure guns will somehow still be accessible https://t.co/u8cQio2ZM6	-0.05523275862068965
So, #GoFundMe ?? Anyone?	-0.07491573033707868
So, @RickSantorum thinks kids should learn CPR instead of calling for gun control. But of course, mouth-to-mouth should only be applied between a boy and a girl, right, Ricky boy? 🙄🤡	-0.0535418032786885
So, here we go again. To the idiot who keeps attempting to flood my timeline with gun control, David Hogg, and other tide pod eating Hitler youth - you are banned for life. I will not tolerate that on this account. Ever. Are we clear?	-0.04832743009320903
So,”gun control”is the new “social societal”hot button!So,is it the “legal”gun owners or those looking to own a gun?Well,what about “legal cops”shooting US daily or a “Shadow Govt”stating #BLM is a terrorist group?But white ppl access to “guns”killing ppl,absolutely “greatness” https://t.co/qcR4ZHQrtO	-0.053410144927536214

You are making my argument back to me. WE NEED GUN CONTROL. They were showing that the gun laws gave white people with guns total power over them because of racism. They just wanted to defend themselves and were "shot down." Bad pun. CA did a good thing for a bad reason-racism. https://t.co/6l8FIXPqf8	-0.0487967280163599
