I will join #MarchForOurLives if it moves away from gun control to addressing the problem of bullying that causes these kids to snap. Deal with the root of the problem, not the leaf that fell in your tea.
Gun owners really should participate in gun control conversations. You should want to prevent insane people from purchasing weaponry to kill in the masses! Stop letting these people out a bad name on gun ownership. Stand up for your right without stripping preventative measures.

We should not have to have a March to make sure our kids make it home from school alive. This is a NO BRAINER. Vote on stronger Gun Control Laws. https://t.co/T2hwyYlEvK
Some ways this *might* be different:

1) Gun control's a specific issue rather than more "romantic" calls for "hope and change" or "revolution" from Obama/Sanders. 

2) Because it's a specific issue, supporters are less "disappointed" bc, say, Obama didn't change the world. https://t.co/0roPfZlo0c
I just got my first block from a pro-NRA Trump cultist. I've never gotten a sweeter gift.    Blue until I die. Veteran with a firearm. Gun control is necessary. Socialism works. Peanut butter is gross...what? I'm just stating empirical facts. üíö my resistance family.
People always have had the guns, so what has changed? .... gun  control could be a fancy way to take away rights. Rights that were  put there to insure we could at least make a stand against our corrupted government.. or at least go out with a fight.
Most news about gun control makes me cry. This was no exception. https://t.co/XNEGrNfYao

I support gun control because I want to become a teacher that their students aren‚Äôt scared to go to school. I think Education is a powerful thing and America has a (moderate) great system and students should not be the targets of any gun. The government needs to change.

Apparently folks are dredging up old gun control tweets. Weird to see stuff I posted several years ago popping up into my notifications... As well as the dopey right-wing death cult responses about knives &amp; kitchen chemicals.
And gun control is all code for

Get whitey
Get whitey
Get whitey
Get whitey

Whitey owns a majority of the legal guns in America. So its why they must be taken away. Cultural Marxism 101. https://t.co/6DZaFk6WaF
While I am glad gun control is finally a talking point, I am saddened that it took white kids to make it so. These barely adults are doing GREAT things...but there's no recognition (from adults) of the black kids who have been saying this forever. https://t.co/RzIlRDknPi
