So the Left wants stricter gun control laws for a protected right "which shall not be infringed".

Only if we ALSO have National Voter ID, E-Verify to work in the US, &amp; legal status in order to receive ANY government benefits.
Hey Parkland kids I love you but please stop promoting solutions that throw people like me under the bus.

When you come from an environment where your friends &amp; people deny the sanctity of live by supporting abortion, then shooting someone else over a disagreement is also no big deal. I would support gun control for these people too. So will all you liberals please turn in your guns?
Hey gun grabbers- even statistical analysis shows you‚Äôre wrong. 2/3 of gun deaths are suicides &amp; there are no policy arguments that will significantly reduce gun deaths. https://t.co/MZMGzyHdxs
I'm pissed off right now. Just had a huge debate over gun control and the gun laws and stuff. Nothing's going to change. The marches are stupid. You take guns away people will still get them. You make them harder to get, people will still get them. Looks at drugs 1/2
It's truly disturbing that Democrats are pushing their agenda thru teenagers screaming for more gun control. The problem isn't gun control. The problem is within the broken people who commit these acts. They have serious mental illness matters that go unaddressed.

Gun control will literally do nothing. 87% of gun crime in this country is committed with an illegal, unregistered weapon. Meaning, anyone protesting guns, is only going after 13% of the problem, and 100% of the safety from it.

I would like to see a study done which correlates a person who characterizes themselves as liberal or conservative with responsible/irresponsible gun ownership.

Honestly, the cherry on top of the #MarchForOurLives protests this weekend was that our spineless bastard of a president ran away to Florida to GOLF instead of actually listening to the people and awknowledging the issue of sensible gun control.
All this gun control stuff is kinda bs . Bc it‚Äôs sad people are losing there lives but it isn‚Äôt just guns to blame . My dad has guns and I have no idea where they are or the key is to the gun safe . Stop blaming guns . And I was told not to freaking  touch .

The worst argument that someone has against gun control is ‚Äúmore kids are killed in ~insert thing here~‚Äù Just because someone is dying in a not so common way doesn‚Äôt mean that we should ignore it. Any lives saved is an achievement, and gun control will save lives.
I can almost understand the gun community being hostile or upset at the idea of gun control, but attacking a group like the Parkland Students who are just TEENS that personally experienced a senseless act of violence that could affect anyone at any time is extremely low.

I've long said if you want gun control laws, encourage black people to legally buy guns. If you want the NRA to come apart at the seams, get black people with guns to join the organization.

in hindsight, the gun control debate ended after harambe. once people decided killing noble primates was ok, i forget how that original tweet ended.
so sick of the gun control debate so the last thing i'll say about it for now:

if you love guns so much, why not literally undergo a procedure to become part gun yourself by simply putting a bullet inside your brain
While I AGREE that Enough Is Enough, and schools need to be safe, security, not gun control, is the answer. Unfortunately, lack of morals, values, &amp; respect for others is the world we live in. Gun control WILL NOT solve this cultural problem.

Gun control is a complex issue; I get that.

Folks who love guns outnumber those of us who don't; I get that, too.

Common sense gun control measures won't stop most of the violence we see or stop school shootings; that's true.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try it.
