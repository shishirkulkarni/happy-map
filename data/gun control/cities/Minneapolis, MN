March for Our Lives Protesters Trash Streets of D.C. After Gun Control March | Breitbart https://t.co/T7RpZ4d3tS
A problem with the gun issue: pro-gun people insist that gun control laws will take away all guns. I have NEVER spoken with a control advocate who wants to disarm completely.

The main argument I've heard from conservatives against #MarchForOurLives has been the Stop School Violence Act. This seems to be a great starting point, but it has nothing to do with gun control. As long as the NRA owns our politicians, there is a problem. Don't miss the point.

But how do you think it plays with the marginal opinion-holder on gun control?
I support the people that went on the march for gun control today . But the only thing that I disagree with is that guns DON’T kill people PEOPLE kill PEOPLE

End goal is gun reform, and we get there by having conversations, in which we are open-minded, respectful, and use common sense. Unfortunately, there can be tune-out by both sides of the issue, especially those heated by the words "gun control". Doesn't mean we should give up. https://t.co/KJW7k7Jm9r
Vote out the people who stand in our way to get safe gun control. We will vote you out if you hide or be like Paul Ryan and many of his cronies. The NRA tried to attack the kids first but that did not work. Now the young people were on the stage in Washington D.C.
Parents are more effective than Gun Control!  Stop raising kids on violent video games, violent movies, unsupervised internet access...stop treating kids like small adults...stop being your kids friend...you are their Parent, their moral compass. Take kids to church.

No problem with protest of school shootings. But if a march is centered on pro-gun control politics that disallow others to speak, it’s not a “March for Our Lives,” it’s a “March for Gun Control.” The media’s duty is to tease that apart. Instead, they complicity conflate the two.
