#GunControlNow -- John Paul Stevens talks repealing the 2nd Amendment.  "Oh, please no!"  There's no way that can happen under current circumstances, and as per HELLER V DC, there's plenty of leeway to assert gun control compatible with the 2nd Amendment.  "Get real, JPS."
Guns were invented around 1400. 

Fully Automatic Weapons (The currently illegal kind) were invented in 1885. 

Yet that entire time the murder rate has dropped consistently? Do gun control people want to save lives or take away rights? ü§îü§îü§î https://t.co/6auxvyGhdu
So why are these kids being treated like experts on #guncontrol, but when @jesseEODM (who survived a mass shooting in a country with very strict gun control) is brushed aside as just being hateful and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about‚Äù #2A #GunRights #leftistsuck

A gun debate compromise: let cities and rural areas pass different laws https://t.co/3yETRYXxwd
We have made our "Moment". Our movement. One option is to pause on gun control education. We saw yesterday that people are educated. Let's generate donations. Speak the language of politician. Spend more than the NRA. Buy them! @MomsDemand @Everytown #MarchForOurLives
The mindwashing of the young is wrong. Guns aren't the problem. Criminals, ignorant politicians, ignorant newsmen and naive citizens are the problem. Gun control laws always play into the hands of criminals because, by definition, they don't obey laws. Use Common sense!
Our system seems to be that most politicians are only controlled by money. Gun control groups are spending money on multiple things besides lobbying. I think it's time to mainly lobby. @Everytown @MomsDemand #MarchForOurLives #Enough #NoMore

So simple are the thoughts of those that think gun control will solve all their problems

The term 'gun control' is being replaced by the term 'gun violence'. The dem Elite must have realized that the latter term is way more powerful to use politically. 'Gun control' is now 'bringing an end to gun violence'. Think about it...

‚ÄúNot trying to take your guns‚Äù but slowly adding more and more and more gun control measures is slowly taking away our guns, until there‚Äôs nothing left. ‚ÄúShall Not Be Infringed‚Äù - December 15th, 1791. üá∫üá∏ #2Ô∏è‚É£üÖ∞Ô∏è https://t.co/SxovktbIPd
The people who are celebrating today because gun control wouldn‚Äôt have prevented the school shooting from happening are SICK. 
STUDENTS WERE SHOT. #GreatMillsHighSchool
"Devices such as bump stocks have no practical application within the civilian realm beyond that of increasing the deadliness of civilian firearms."

If all these politicians are so desperate to pass any other law besides gun control, have they considered looking at banning daylight savings?
We're devastated to hear of yet another school shooting, barely a month after the tragedy in Parkland, Florida. It's time for an end to this inaction on gun violence. Our legislators need to pass sensible gun control measures now. #enough https://t.co/dRKfzKKZrj
Gun. Control. NOW! https://t.co/MLK3HJVnod
Guess what?  They ALL want to take YOUR guns away! https://t.co/xqGMSqHxU6
time for additional car control, just like additional gun control  #thefive
shoutout the officer that took out the school shooter in maryland before any fatalities today. i'm pro-gun control but also pro-good guy with a gun in these situations.
Surprised it took this long for some asshole to make an ignorant comment about my gun control tweet. I really thought the mouth breathers would've come out in force sooner. (He quote tweeted, so we'll see what that brings.)

The argument for gun control is it saves lives despite it violating someone's right. However, many of those supporters support a woman's right to have an abortion regardless up until the baby is born and don't want that limited. Seems inconsistent to me, a life is a life.

Exactly. It shouldn't be a choice between better mental health services and better gun control. We should have both. https://t.co/tYy3UmswId
So highschool from my hometown had a shooting today. And people are up in arms about gun laws....

If you don't realize this already, MD has some of the craziest strict gun control laws I've ever seen. 
If someone wants a gun, they get it.

Stop sending prayers to school shootings! CBS News, America, no more payers!  A dog dies on a plane and action is taken. Send prayers for reform, pray for gun control. Pray for no more NRA bribe money to be taken by politicians. Pray that something changes.

If your first tendency is to post a snarky comment about gun control or walkouts when a school shooting happens...maybe don't?
Another school shooting still no plans for gun control

A gun control advocate promoting gun violence, Democrat double speak.The 2A allows citizens to protect themselves from a government that turns against them, not to remove those you don‚Äôt like. Imagine if this argument was floated in response to DACA. https://t.co/3ubWLqGCNS
Sometimes advocates for gun control say, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt *need* an AR-15 to hunt a deer.‚Äù  My response would be, who determines what I ‚Äúneed‚Äù?  I say I need an AR-15 with a 30-round magazine; who are you to tell me otherwise?
Well, I might have turned one in if I owned one.   They never asked in Denver how many actually owned one.  I shoot and never heard of one, or saw one.

Yet turning them in was "common sense gun control" essential for our safety.

What a circus. https://t.co/P7jLlBEtAE

I usually bash the president, but I'm genuinely proud of him on gun control. He's not just trying, he called out the NRA and Republican Senators for refusing to act. I appreciate that. I just hope he rethinks arming teachers.

If you criticize prayer as "useless words" but are jonesing for gun control, I've got some bad news for you...
Yes, share a story from 2014 on your Facebook wall about a school stabbing to prove that gun control is pointless but don't say it's from 2014 in your post. Cool, cool. (I looked for the original article b/c I was confused why something like that wasn't trending on Twitter.)

I'm on the fence about all these damn gun laws. How do other countries handle it? Do they make the laws more strict or lenient? It's incredibly difficult to control our country with this threat looming.
