You can build your own gun with a 3D printer. How does control work in other countries? Other countries have more severe consequences. America let‚Äôs certain people get away with everything.
I get both sides. I get why people are against gun control and I get why people are with it. My heart and soul are with those who have suffered from shootings. Gun control is a start but at the same time if someone wants something they won‚Äôt stop at anything

Yrs ago a very good friend of mine walked into a sporting goods store, bought a gun, went home and killed herself. I wonder if stricter gun laws could have saved her. I think about it a lot. Gun control can save lives in many different ways.
Also, why is gun control only brought up when there are mass shootings? You only want to cry about banning "assault" rifles, when there's hundreds of people dying in the streets of St. Louis, Detroit, and Chicago every year from handguns. #ChangeMyMind #GunControlNow

There‚Äôs no doubt this man is a hero, but there are a few more reasons this didn‚Äôt end in more bloodshed:
1. The shooter was using a pistol, not an AR-15. He could *be* confronted without waiting for SWAT to show. 
2. Maryland has strict gun control laws. He couldn‚Äôt get an AR-15. https://t.co/l9GHu00TQY

REMINDER: if you want common sense gun legislation to get passed, you have to vote out every Republican from power everywhere, from every office, local, State, &amp; Federal. NOTHING changes for the better while the GOP is in control. Vote for Democrats, who support YOU, not the NRA.
I'm just in tears this morning seeing these people out all over the world just asking for sensible gun control.  This is a no brainer people.  Dear @GOP &amp; @DNC U represent us and NOT the @NRA Don't do anything?  Fine, you will no longer be there during UR next election for you.

Why are these people marching for gun control? Do they not realize that restricting our freedom and taking our guns away is the equivalent of making us sheep in a field of wolves? Why would you march for that instead of against it?
All I see is a bunch of scared children being used by the Left to push an agenda of Control! 2nd amendment is Our Right! What you need to understand is that a GUN JUST LAYS THERE UNTIL A HUMAN PICKS IT UP AND USES IT.....like a hammer or a knife or any inanimate object! https://t.co/16NtK5AS2h
