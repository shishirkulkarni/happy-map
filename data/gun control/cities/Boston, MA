Anyone else think this gun control sounds a little familiar like.. hmm.. I don't know.... NAZI GERMANY!

So please take our guns so we can be controlled and defenceless like the Germans when the Nazi's tookover
Of course we should repeal the second amendment. GOP's financial interests have made reasonable arms regulations impossible for most of the country.

Here in MA, we have sensible gun control. But our neighbor NH has no such regulations, leading to influx of illegal guns from NH.

I support sensible gun control, but we need to have an honest and informed discussion. "Assault" in this context means "black" and "semiautomatic" means "not automatic."

Bravo for former Justice Stevens call to repeal the archaic (no need to keep armed for a militia anymore) 2nd Amendment. Too bad, though, that he fails to note the MANY openings for gun control Scalia himself wrote into DC v Heller. They are listed here https://t.co/2WmjHfl5vX
I think saying "Repeal the Second Amendment" is surefire way to make sure nothing gets done. The Gun nuts will overreact, the NRA will double down on their paid Congressman &amp; no sensible gun control changes will happen. I don't like guns, but don't think repealing is good idea.
Instead of gun control, we should supply every school with enough body bags for all the students

CPR isn’t going to do jack-shit for a student riddled with bullets. CPR has about a 10-15% survival rate, as in: few patients leave the hospital if they need to be resuscitated. CPR is a last resort. Gun control is the preventative method. @RickSantorum #googlesantorum

The only “gun control” that will keep citizens from killing citizens is ultimate seizure of ALL guns of all types. Germany did that years ago. Citizens lost the “right” to defend themselves. That ain’t gonna happen in America. So other than stirring up division-what’s the point?
These people are the definition of why we need gun control. Also, these are the people I would never give a gun license to.

I think my favorite thing to come out of March For Our Lives has been the right's reaction. Literally millions of people marching for gun control vs literally hundreds huddled in Walmart parking lots to celebrate guns. It doesn't take a psychic to see the future here.
Someone tried to tell me that the NeverAgain movement wasn’t about getting rid of the 2A, and that it was “just about gun control.” So just to clear the air... this left wing movement’s only goal is to ABOLISH the 2A. #2A #ProtectYourRights 🇺🇸 https://t.co/JUs4i0CFWX

Yall want Gun control now that a bunch of white kids died. I hear gunshots every other week in the hood tho.
We need 66% of the Senate and House, then 75% of the States to ratify.  It is by far the hardest path, but it would defeat (in time) the NRA and #SCOTUS would fight FOR limiting gun control, not AGAINST it. @SethMacFarlane @StephenKing @BretStephensNYT https://t.co/kXVLMghCmX

“There’s no political agenda in bullying, that’s why they want the 2nd amendment taken away!” 1) don’t act like you give a shit about bullying now 2) not knowing the difference between gun CONTROL and a gun BAN is probably because you listened to someone with a political agenda
Both sides of this gun control debate are just straight up fear mongering, the irony is too much
Gun control arguments have officially made my brain go numb. Those fighting for tighter gun laws are passionate but I just don't think getting strict on guns will solve the problem. Getting rid of the symptom is easy. It's getting to the cause that takes effort.
March for our Lives was an astounding success!  Marches in cities all across America.  The turnout in D.C. was beyond belief.  Now what happens?  Do you believe we will get meaningful gun control regulations, or just more hot air and inaction from the politicians?  #DCtravesty

March for our Lives: Massachusetts cities rally for tighter gun control https://t.co/0q4exIf4un
I would say so! A simple but effective and compelling political ad. Just focus on one thing: an assault weapons ban. Incremental. Build momentum for more comprehensive gun control. https://t.co/BkCFO86w1D

I think that the guidelines for when a police officer is validated in using their firearms need to be re-evaluated. Realistically if gun control is strengthened throughout the country there should be no need for officers to carry firearms https://t.co/ziX9W8NL1j

Cute things today: The sheer amount of white women at the March for Our Lives wearing pussy hats as if they aren’t transphobic, shitty, and entirely unrelated to gun control. Like, we get it. You’re woke. Stop wearing that childish shit. Don’t be a TERF.
It’s incredible to see countries like Australia &amp; England stand in solidarity with America on gun control. Our elected officials make fools of the US on a daily basis sometimes directly attacking them. But they are willing to look past that &amp; see the humanity.

My thoughts on the question of "gun control" (which usually translates to "giving more power to the enforcement arm of the capitalist state") aside, I find it so inspiring to see so many folks my age and younger turning out to protest this country's culture of violence.

I once asked my uncle, a Lt. Colonel in the Army what he thought about gun control and the ability to own assault weapons, he almost emotionless, but more serious than I had ever seen him with "No civilian should ever have access to that kind of power..."
Reminder: young people are in fact *more* skeptical about gun control than their forebears. It's just that corporate interests and the media don't give those young people airtime.

So the gun control debate boils down to two groups:

People who think the government has the ability to eliminate a threat which they are incapable of quantifying correctly.

Vs.

People who think guns have the ability to eliminate the same improbable threat.

White people really don’t give a fuck until it effects them. Didn’t care bout white supremacist targeting black n such but once Nazis were in the picture they cared. Didn’t care about kids getting shot n better gun control until WHITE kids started getting shot.
One initial takeaway from the #MarchForOurLivesdc: the coalition for gun control is wide-ranging and motivated by personal experience. People here care about the wellbeing of their family and friends and that’s what brought them out today.

If more of Blue America read or watched conservative media, or had more friends in Red America, they’d know how intractable the gun divide really is. Gun control isn’t going to be like gay marriage, which appealed to common American intuitions about treating everyone equally.

The orange bloatbomb scumbag motherfucker golfs at Mar A Lago while millions march against him , the NRA, the repugs and for sensible gun control. They will be THROWN OUT if they do not foster change.
the fact that we have to march in the streets to get a so called “president” and the so called “government” to understand that gun control is a serious thing ... is really disturbing.

The trouble with gun control is that guns last decades, even longer if they're taken care of. So whatever law you pass, it could take a long, long time before it really starts to make an impact. And people aren't that patient. They want immediate results. Well, not happening.

The only thing about these kids speaking out on gun control that should make you angry is the realization that we’ve failed to protect them so utterly and completely that they now have to do it themselves.
If politicians didn’t want children to be involved with gun control, they should have listened to their constituents. Wish I could be at the march ❤️ #NoMore #VoteThemOut #MarchForOurLives
Wow watching you “adults” on @FoxNews exploit high schooler, &amp; shooting survivor, Kyle Kashuv, using him as the voice of reason on the gun control debate. He is anti-gun regulation, which is fine. The 100’s of thousands marchers today aren’t!

Gun laws must be made to control the safety if our state. I believe a firearm should have one owner and only be in the hands of that person. This will prevent “gifting” and multiple sales of the firearm. Background checks must also be more thorough and in depth. #asafeNH

Please tell me what the state could have done through gun control to prevent this tragedy.
