Man white people on Facebook get so pressed when you talk about gun control... like, sure buddy, guns are more important than people‚Äôs lives.
Gun control does not mean to Repeal the Second Amendment.

Making sure you don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbomb‚Äù or ‚Äúthis place will explode‚Äù inside an airport or airplane is in fact, not banning the First Amendment.

Just like any other laws, our Constitution must be regulated to ensure safety.

#livepd Can we get this guy's thoughts on gun control
If I was president I'd pass whatever gun control law you want as long as it was passed with tougher laws to cut down on distracted drivers.
You know I've figured out that most people arguing for stricter gun control don't know the difference between automatic and semi automatic guns, and also have never owned a gun and had to go through the process of getting an extensive background check to own a gun legally
I just got a sponsored ad tweet from somebody who described themselves as a "classical liberal" in their bio; the tweet said "Always remember, the ultimate goal of gun control is to leave you defenseless."

How the hell did I get that as a sponsored ad given everything I tweet?

What Marco (and others) fail to recognize is there are far more constituents in favor of gun control than those who oppose it. Democracy by its very nature favors the majority.

The @NRA thinking they have control over gun laws is like a class president thinking they have control over school rules. No.
I hope someone asks Bernie Sanders, on camera, if he agrees with his former(?) surrogate Killer Mike on the NRA and sensible gun control.
really ashamed to be part of the brainwashed generation of millennials parading through the streets demanding for gun control using twitter memes instead of using actual arguments

If a something is not working why use the same approach over again? A lot of politicians knows certain things will not work, but use it over again anyways (because that‚Äôs what people want to hear). People want to hear ban assault rifle and gun control, when gun is not the issue.

FACT: Where legal, gun ownership goes up, gun violence by criminals, gangs and illegal immigrants goes down. It‚Äôs that simple.

School safety protocols IS the issue. Not gun control, more gun laws, the NRA or revising the 2A.

Pleasantly surprised that some media are calling this a protest against gun ‚Äúviolence‚Äù and not a call for gun control (though that is more accurate). I hope all people around the world considering gun violence will listen and choose not to be violent w/guns or any weapons.
