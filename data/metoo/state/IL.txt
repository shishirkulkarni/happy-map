America's such a racist nation that, yes, I could easily see #MeToo getting completely out of hand and dragging black men into prison, death row, the current form of legal lynching, never mind the private prison slavery. Fuck you, America.
I love @TerryGilliam. I love all his movies. He may have said something stupid. There's no doubt interested #Capital is at play in the #MeToo movement; hiring lawyers, muddying #SexualHarassment waters, seeking unscrupulous financial advantage. It's naive to imagine otherwise.
Have to wonder about all those false rape accusations by white women over the generations since the American Civil War and what the #MeToo stance would be on that, I am curious.
I'm not going to get too into it but #MeToo may be a mob rule in the eyes of some but it started out as, and it still should be, a message of solidarity. Not just for cis women but for cis men as well as GNC, non-binary, and trans people.

Monday sessions: WHM Sexual Assault and #MeToo Discussion. Refreshments will be served. See you there!
#MarchForOurLives Common sense says that if Gun Free Zones stops mass shootings Rape Free Zones in Hollywood would stop this #Metoo shit. Enough is enough!!  Why do we not have Rape Free Zones? It's common sense!
A darker underside to this @ a societal level is the set of conditions that made her think @ the time she "deserved" this due to her bad choices. Can we support each other &amp; say, "That's a bunch of patriarchal üêéüí©"? We must teach our kids that "No" is *always* an option. #metoo https://t.co/tddaey6BBH

Even though sex was consensual &amp; Stormy does NOT claim to be victim of sexual assault (just really bad taste), the hush money, implied physical harm by a thug &amp; threats of financial ruin by thug lawyers representing Trump, elements of #METoo are in play here #StormyDanielsDay
it's very important that #StormyDaniels recognize the irreparable consequences of her name being associated with the #metoo movement recognizing that she was never a victim on the first place. Take her out of the movement, let her speak her own truth #StormyDanielsDay

I would really like to get an answer, are there any republican families who believe in The March For Our Lives movement?
 Any republican women who support the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement?
Record number of black women are candidates in Alabama:

They're fueled by Democrat Doug Jones' stunning upset Senate win, the #MeToo movement, opposition to Trump and a desire to carry on Obama's legacy

Everyone should be able to feel safe where they live. This is one reason that #MeToo conversations are so important in the housing &amp; homelessness world #TalkItOut
#MeToo was popularized through the stories by famous women. As it has grown it continues to expand to include the experiences of diverse women: domestic workers, farm workers, women in politics. #TalkItOut
We need to make sure that women experiencing homelessness are heard and supported by the #MeToo movement #TalkItOut @ChiFdn4Women https://t.co/fETNQzTZ7V
#MeToo has implications for women's mentorship &amp; access to opportunities. We need to continue to #TalkItOut to ensure women are not penalized by a #MeToo backlash. https://t.co/HdjxeMop0A
It strikes me funny that in the age of #MeToo and Cambridge Analytica, Facebook is complaining about the "burden of consent" when it comes to user data.
Let's start off with Q1: Nearly 6 months since the first allegations broke, we're still talking about #MeToo &amp; sexual harassment. Why is it still important to have this conversation? #TalkItOut
ICYMI: #MeToo has been used by women sharing their personal experiences of sexual harassment, assault &amp; abuse. #MeToo was created in 2006 by @TaranaBurke to support survivors of sexual violence. Learn more about Tarana's work: https://t.co/4JwjYgl9js

America's such a racist nation that, yes, I could easily see #MeToo getting completely out of hand and dragging black men into prison, death row, the current form of legal lynching, never mind the private prison slavery. Fuck you, America.
Have to wonder about all those false rape accusations by white women over the generations since the American Civil War and what the #MeToo stance would be on that, I am curious.
