So Terry Gilliam is going to be destroyed for poorly expressing a legitimate opinion about mob rule and #MeToo, thus definitively proving the primary premise of his opinion.

I believe that's called irony. It's also a further indication of the totally messed up world we live in. https://t.co/ijk8Vhec3Y

Honestly not throwing any shade, but can Facebook come up with a tool to make it a lot easier to identify friends who changed their last name after getting married? And by friends I mean girls because in the era of #MeToo this is still somehow a thing. #maidennames4ever
Just throw the whole thread away. Men acting like our experiences are so black &amp; white, you either reject or you don‚Äôt, is the reason why movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp exist.

Entertainment has never been separate from the political (and to an extent never can be), but as that fact becomes more and more apparent with movements like #MeToo, calling someone "just an entertainer" to deflect criticisms of their politics will become less and less viable.

I am happy to see Stormy Daniels taking on Trump. However, there were two porn stars at that golf tournament. One turned him down and told the world her story before the election - before #metoo  The other fucked him and got paid $130K. Choose your #Heroes wisely.
Just a friendly reminder.... Men, what you want to be on the lookout for is ENTHUSIASTICALLY consensual sex. Anything less than enthusiastic consent is bad sex at best and rape at worst. #StormyDanielsDay #azizansari #rape #MeToo #consent
Bill Clinton and Trump had affairs. As far as I know, neither GWB or Obama did. #MeToo stories have taken down Dems and Republicans. There are skeezy people on both sides, yet one party acts as if they're the beacon of morality and uses religion to divide people.
Stormy Daniels ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not part of the Me Too Movement‚Äù and I agree. She‚Äôs probably asking Why Not Me instead? #StormyDanielsDay #StormyDaniels #StormySunday #MeToo #TimesUp https://t.co/jAQOhQiaa0

What‚Äôs scary about the #StormyDaniels story, is that Trump slandered her, used the threat of lawsuit, physically had people threaten her in front of her child, and ultimately paid her $150,000 just to silence her. In the time of #metoo, women don‚Äôt want to be silenced any longer.

I was afraid to say anything about the emotional abuse I went through from Orion Acaba because I was afriad of what he would do to me in retaliation &amp; I was also afraid that people wouldn't believe me. But I'm glad I came forward. I truely hope he gets help. #metoo #criticalrole

In the age of #MeToo's and #TimesUp's , I encourage more women to spend less time being outraged but rather pursue the fields traditionally dominated by men. #Crypto is a great industry that is wide open.
I‚Äôve played @TheSatelliteLA and absolutely adore this venue but if they blatantly disregard this issue and book Danny Masterson, someone who is known to be a danger to women, then it‚Äôs on them. I can‚Äôt support them anymore. #MeToo https://t.co/aZSDrcQ10r

The one thing that‚Äôs fucked up about the #MeToo climate is we have absolutely painted all those accused as guilty in the court of public opinion already.
