A1 #MeToo should be a reminder to clean up your manners and habits -- not just in women's presence -- but in all social interactions. #OMCchat	0.010677298850574708
A1: I think that companies are taking a more honest look at their culture &amp; practices--whether out of conviction or desire not to be convicted. #MeToo #OMCchat	0.013223428571428586
A2 In light of #MeToo, men should have less automatic hirings for positions. #OMCchat	0.008359248554913266
A2: Not sure that it has--yet. I think it'll take some time for #MeToo lessons to filter through hiring practices, beginning w/ where you look for talent &amp; what you look for in talent. Keep fishing in same old pond; get same old fish. #OMCchat	0.009549855907780954
A4. I'm happy that the #MeToo movement as given so many the courage to speak out, but it seems to have developed the negative quality of shutting people out/up who have nuanced perspectives. At least, that's what I've experienced. #fblchat	2.733727810650822E-4
A4: Dunno whether that's happened yet-- #MeToo isn't even six months old. That's pretty much ramming speed for business practices. #OMCchat	0.008359248554913266
A5 Any change to hiring processes can be complicated until kinks are worked out. #MeToo adjustments are one example. #OMCchat	0.008359248554913266
A5: I may be a cockeyed optimist, but I think it will (though probably hasn't yet). #MeToo is an #inclusive movement. #OMCchat	0.008359248554913266

I believe people should expose any abuse that is done.However, in this #METOO era, there are people, it seems mostly women,who are making false claims. If you knowingly go into a hotel with a man when you are an adult to "discuss business", do not claim innocence after the fact.	0.02546491935483874
I believe this 100%. It's steeped in respectability politics. Only certain types of women are deemed "worthy" of complaining about harassment.
