젠더 이슈를 정치에 끌어들이는 건 대체로 페어 플레이 안하겠단 결심이다. 정치가, 일회성 이슈 제기가 수십세기 아닌 수백세기에 걸친 젠더 이슈를 간단하게 해결할수 있다고 절대 기대않는다. #MeToo 가 그걸 해결하리라고 믿는것 순진을 넘어 멍청한거다.
I get why #DrewBarrymore wants to minimize anger in #MeToo. But a) that's a very white expectation, that no one get publicly mad, and b) it's a repetition of ancient restrictive expectations of women. Is is possible to forge new norms while adhering to the old ones? I dunno...

When #MeToo first started, a male acquaintance didn't believe so many wo/men couldve been sexually assaulted. He thought that meant his friends must be rapists. This talk has great stats about repeat offenders &amp; how rarely anything is done.

3 things: 1) I love (many of) the films of @TerryGilliam. "Brazil" is and will long remain one of my top 3 favorite films, and 2) What he said about #MeToo is wrong and misinformed. 3) The truth of statements 1 &amp; 2 are not mutually exclusive.

Jennifer Lopez Shares #MeToo Story Of Sexual Harassment via @aplusapp https://t.co/IENIeuGNM7
After bringing attention to the dangers of mob mentality and how simple criticisms of the #metoo movement can be career ending, Terry Gilliam just essentially got stepped on by a giant foot in the sky
So, Terry Gilliam has essentially confessed to sexual harassment.

Mark my words, those who speak out against #MeToo are the ones that stand the most to lose.
Women who achieve great things are forgotten. In business, in science, in tech, and in politics. It happens at all levels. This is all too familiar to me. #seeher #metoo https://t.co/hy6Eep5VhM
