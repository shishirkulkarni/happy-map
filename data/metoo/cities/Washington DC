Soo working on an article about the cam girl thing during the #metoo era and so far the women like @XXXAmberLynns are the worst. They see everything as a transaction, seeing feet is $5, touching nose is $10, and its just worst than a strip club dealing with her. but interview me?

Loved #SNL tonight EXCEPT one little (not at all little) thing, the #MeToo sketch. They’ve had other ones like it, and as a survivor, it feels like we’re being belittled and mocked. Not sure if that was their intention, but reading people’s responses, it’s not a joke to them.

It’s a firm conviction of most of our egalitarian culture that men as men do not owe women a special kind of care and protection and honor that women do not owe men. Clearly, that's hurting us. @desiringGod #MeToo https://t.co/IDCpuFP2AA
Terry Gilliam is entirely correct. If you don't get that you shouldn't be following me because I'll probably say things you don't want to hear. 
#MeToo caused a good Senator to resign for no reason, and the death of a person: her name was Jill Messick, and she did nothing wrong.

플랫폼들도 이제 경각심을 가져야할 때 입니다. 작품에서부터 작가 닉네임까지 여혐문화를 키워온 작품들이 많습니다. 많은 독자들이 이 점을 지적해왔고 이제부터라도 플랫폼에서 대처해주길 바랍니다.

이번 미투운동으로 만화 속에 여혐 표현을 즐겨 표현하였으며 성희롱을 일삼은 작가들이 강간문화를 키워내는데 한몫했단걸 깨닫고 반성하길 바랍니다. 나아가 만화협회에서도 그런 작가들에게 경고를 주길 바랍니다.

When widely respected white men seem to have not been following the #metoo mvmt it’s irksome. Women are threatened all the time and many don’t report it bc they are afraid, bc they won’t be believed.

I watched the #60Minutes interview w/ #Stormy &amp; believe that, despite her disassociation w/ #MeToo, she was a victim if she slept w/Trump because she didn't know how to say no. She later blamed herself for going to his room in hopes of landing a job on The Apprentice.

She said this isn’t a #MeToo issue but it actually became one the SECOND he threatened her in front of an infant daughter. #StormyDanielsDay
I think Stormy Daniels story of feel obliged to have sex based on allowing herself to be in the situation is an issue in the "consent" &amp; when is it rape rape.  I wonder how many women have had sex unwillingly but do not feel they have been raped or victimized.  #MeToo
Women: even if you end up alone in a room with a wealthy, powerful man - you don’t have to be coerced into sex. You don’t “deserve it” because “you got yourself into that situation.” 

#MeToo #StormyDanielsDay
Stormy Daniels said that hers is not a #MeToo situation, but not wanting to have sex and feeling you *have* to have sex is indeed a part of it. Women should WANT TO HAVE SEX before they have sex, not feel like they have to do it because it is expected.
I woke up just in time to turn on CBS and watch Stormy Daniels describe a #MeToo moment...while saying this was not a #MeToo moment.
#StormyDaniels: Got to give her credit, it’s a good thing that she clarified that her experience is not a #MeToo story. She gets points for me on that alone. #60Minutes

You’d think that especially after the #metoo movement people would at least THINK before making dumbass decisions
One thing to note: people trashed the women’s march because it didn’t lead to action/wasn’t specific enough. Now, a record number of women are running. #MeToo followed this act of solidarity. We’ll see the affects of #MarchForOurLives for years to come

There are four primary responses one might have to abusers: flight, fight, freeze and accomodate. The last one sat with me deeply, because so many times in abusive relationships, we accomodate our abusers because they make us believe we are the problem #MeToo

I believe this 100%. It's steeped in respectability politics. Only certain types of women are deemed "worthy" of complaining about harassment. Of course the #MeToo movement was not FOUNDED on that basis, but the current focus seems to be on some voices over others. #BETBreaks https://t.co/66u6oa6jPx
If you wonder why I have almost no respect for the #MeToo group, this is why. I believe almost NO rape or sexual harassment claims now, because this seems to be the most common result. https://t.co/IuJB4ej98A

Soo working on an article about the cam girl thing during the #metoo era and so far the women like @XXXAmberLynns are the worst. They see everything as a transaction, seeing feet is $5, touching nose is $10, and its just worst than a strip club dealing with her. but interview me?

Loved #SNL tonight EXCEPT one little (not at all little) thing, the #MeToo sketch. They’ve had other ones like it, and as a survivor, it feels like we’re being belittled and mocked. Not sure if that was their intention, but reading people’s responses, it’s not a joke to them.

I believe people should expose any abuse that is done.However, in this #METOO era, there are people, it seems mostly women,who are making false claims. If you knowingly go into a hotel with a man when you are an adult to "discuss business", do not claim innocence after the fact.
