A1 #MeToo should be a reminder to clean up your manners and habits -- not just in women's presence -- but in all social interactions. #OMCchat	-0.011367429760665975
A1- I think it has given them ( women and men) a voice that such actions will not be tolerated. #OMCChat #METoo	-0.032110496794871775
A1.  The cat is out of the bag. What wasn‚Äôt said before is now &amp; that is great. We welcome the #MeToo movement. #OMCchat https://t.co/KX7DCRs8mn	-0.04076267942583726

A2 In light of #MeToo, men should have less automatic hirings for positions. #OMCchat	-0.011367429760665975
A2- Not sure it will have as great an effect on men, short term, but it should. Men typically won't talk about as quickly, probably will see a greater awareness of! #OMCChat #METoo	-0.032110496794871775
A2. I do not think it will. I think the #MeToo movement has shown that women are stronger &amp; just as qualified as men, if not more qualified. #OMCChat https://t.co/qEtfrJKieA	-0.04076267942583726
A2:  I would hope that the #MeToo movement has reminded interviewers of the Do's and Don'ts when interviewing.  #OMCchat	-0.03511185800604225
A2: Not sure that it has--yet. I think it'll take some time for #MeToo lessons to filter through hiring practices, beginning w/ where you look for talent &amp; what you look for in talent. Keep fishing in same old pond; get same old fish. #OMCchat	-0.011367429760665975

A4- Great question, would love to see some data. But how wrong is that if the numbers are up just because, should be meaningful. #OMCChat #METoo	-0.032110496794871775
A4. I'm happy that the #MeToo movement as given so many the courage to speak out, but it seems to have developed the negative quality of shutting people out/up who have nuanced perspectives. At least, that's what I've experienced. #fblchat	-0.011571794871794877
A4: Dunno whether that's happened yet-- #MeToo isn't even six months old. That's pretty much ramming speed for business practices. #OMCchat	-0.011367429760665975
A5 Any change to hiring processes can be complicated until kinks are worked out. #MeToo adjustments are one example. #OMCchat	-0.011367429760665975
A5- I don't look at from the number of hires, rather, hopefully the amount of "inappropriate activity" gas decreased. Hope that the incidence of reporting goes up then levels off.

A5. It certainly has opened more opportunities for all genders. The #MeToo movement should not have an impact towards men or complicate issues. If a company is having trouble it is not due to the movement but rather the company needing to change how they operate . #OMCChat https://t.co/e8KiRKPJxL	-0.04076267942583726
A5:  I don't know how we can quantify the data needed to answer this question just yet. We are still in the center of the #MeToo movement.  #OMCchat	-0.03511185800604225
A5: I may be a cockeyed optimist, but I think it will (though probably hasn't yet). #MeToo is an #inclusive movement. #OMCchat	-0.011367429760665975
A5: Men are discriminated against in hiring decisions in HR. Except for the top jobs held by men, most decisions are made by women who select in their own image. Is this a #MeToo issue? Probably not. #OMCchat	-0.03511185800604225
