So Terry Gilliam is going to be destroyed for poorly expressing a legitimate opinion about mob rule and #MeToo, thus definitively proving the primary premise of his opinion.

I believe that's called irony. It's also a further indication of the totally messed up world we live in. https://t.co/ijk8Vhec3Y

Honestly not throwing any shade, but can Facebook come up with a tool to make it a lot easier to identify friends who changed their last name after getting married? And by friends I mean girls because in the era of #MeToo this is still somehow a thing. #maidennames4ever
Just throw the whole thread away. Men acting like our experiences are so black &amp; white, you either reject or you don‚Äôt, is the reason why movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp exist.

Entertainment has never been separate from the political (and to an extent never can be), but as that fact becomes more and more apparent with movements like #MeToo, calling someone "just an entertainer" to deflect criticisms of their politics will become less and less viable.

I am happy to see Stormy Daniels taking on Trump. However, there were two porn stars at that golf tournament. One turned him down and told the world her story before the election - before #metoo  The other fucked him and got paid $130K. Choose your #Heroes wisely.
Just a friendly reminder.... Men, what you want to be on the lookout for is ENTHUSIASTICALLY consensual sex. Anything less than enthusiastic consent is bad sex at best and rape at worst. #StormyDanielsDay #azizansari #rape #MeToo #consent
Bill Clinton and Trump had affairs. As far as I know, neither GWB or Obama did. #MeToo stories have taken down Dems and Republicans. There are skeezy people on both sides, yet one party acts as if they're the beacon of morality and uses religion to divide people.
Stormy Daniels ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not part of the Me Too Movement‚Äù and I agree. She‚Äôs probably asking Why Not Me instead? #StormyDanielsDay #StormyDaniels #StormySunday #MeToo #TimesUp https://t.co/jAQOhQiaa0

What‚Äôs scary about the #StormyDaniels story, is that Trump slandered her, used the threat of lawsuit, physically had people threaten her in front of her child, and ultimately paid her $150,000 just to silence her. In the time of #metoo, women don‚Äôt want to be silenced any longer.

I was afraid to say anything about the emotional abuse I went through from Orion Acaba because I was afriad of what he would do to me in retaliation &amp; I was also afraid that people wouldn't believe me. But I'm glad I came forward. I truely hope he gets help. #metoo #criticalrole

In the age of #MeToo's and #TimesUp's , I encourage more women to spend less time being outraged but rather pursue the fields traditionally dominated by men. #Crypto is a great industry that is wide open.
I‚Äôve played @TheSatelliteLA and absolutely adore this venue but if they blatantly disregard this issue and book Danny Masterson, someone who is known to be a danger to women, then it‚Äôs on them. I can‚Äôt support them anymore. #MeToo https://t.co/aZSDrcQ10r

The one thing that‚Äôs fucked up about the #MeToo climate is we have absolutely painted all those accused as guilty in the court of public opinion already.

I watched the #60Minutes interview w/ #Stormy &amp; believe that, despite her disassociation w/ #MeToo, she was a victim if she slept w/Trump because she didn't know how to say no. She later blamed herself for going to his room in hopes of landing a job on The Apprentice.

She said this isn‚Äôt a #MeToo issue but it actually became one the SECOND he threatened her in front of an infant daughter. #StormyDanielsDay
I think Stormy Daniels story of feel obliged to have sex based on allowing herself to be in the situation is an issue in the "consent" &amp; when is it rape rape.  I wonder how many women have had sex unwillingly but do not feel they have been raped or victimized.  #MeToo
Women: even if you end up alone in a room with a wealthy, powerful man - you don‚Äôt have to be coerced into sex. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve it‚Äù because ‚Äúyou got yourself into that situation.‚Äù 

#MeToo #StormyDanielsDay
Stormy Daniels said that hers is not a #MeToo situation, but not wanting to have sex and feeling you *have* to have sex is indeed a part of it. Women should WANT TO HAVE SEX before they have sex, not feel like they have to do it because it is expected.
I woke up just in time to turn on CBS and watch Stormy Daniels describe a #MeToo moment...while saying this was not a #MeToo moment.

I believe this 100%. It's steeped in respectability politics. Only certain types of women are deemed "worthy" of complaining about harassment. Of course the #MeToo movement was not FOUNDED on that basis, but the current focus seems to be on some voices over others. #BETBreaks https://t.co/66u6oa6jPx

"We call on airports, airlines, &amp; government agencies to immediately enlist everyone traveling in an effort to stop sexual harassment &amp; sexual assault. The greater the discussion, the safer all passengers, crew and airport workers will be."  - @FlyingwithSara #MeToo #TimesUp
‚ÄúI applaud Alaska CEO Brad Tilden &amp; United CEO Oscar Munoz. They immediately spoke up and are leading the industry in this dialog, putting in place tools &amp; training for frontline workers and working to change the culture toward true equality.‚Äù - @FlyingWithSara  #metoo #TimesUp
Long before #MeToo, Cynthia Nixon was harassed by a sandwich https://t.co/mgaeqyHkZU
"A survey of our members just last year showed the majority of Flight Attendants have no knowledge of written guidance or training on this issue available through their airline." - @FlyingWithSara  #metoo #TimesUp
"Our union was formed to give women a voice and to beat back discrimination and misogyny faced on the job." - @FlyingWithSara #metoo #timesup #1u
‚ÄúNot that long ago, the industry marketed the objectification of ‚Äústewardesses,‚Äù a job only available to young, single, perfectly polished women who until 1993 were required to step on a weight scale.‚Äù - @FlyingwithSara #MeToo
"Sexual harassment is not about sex; it is about power. Flight Attendants, about 80 percent women, are ongoing victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault." - @FlyingwithSara #metoo

I think comments like Terry Gilliam's show why it's not great to center #metoo on Hollywood, it's harder to blow off thousands of hotel housekeeping staff as ambitious women who "knew what they were getting into"
The #MeToo movement comes for Mike Isabella and I'm not surprised in the least; Isabella's hypermasculine bravado and misogynistic tendencies on the show were clear indicators of this sort of behavior and he and his business partners ought to bear significant repercussions https://t.co/u9L7R87Zsl

Also, FYI,  you CAN stand with Nolan Bushnell, against Brianna Wu and GDC, but still support #MeToo and Time's Up.

America's such a racist nation that, yes, I could easily see #MeToo getting completely out of hand and dragging black men into prison, death row, the current form of legal lynching, never mind the private prison slavery. Fuck you, America.
I love @TerryGilliam. I love all his movies. He may have said something stupid. There's no doubt interested #Capital is at play in the #MeToo movement; hiring lawyers, muddying #SexualHarassment waters, seeking unscrupulous financial advantage. It's naive to imagine otherwise.
Have to wonder about all those false rape accusations by white women over the generations since the American Civil War and what the #MeToo stance would be on that, I am curious.
I'm not going to get too into it but #MeToo may be a mob rule in the eyes of some but it started out as, and it still should be, a message of solidarity. Not just for cis women but for cis men as well as GNC, non-binary, and trans people.

‚ÄòWonder Woman‚Äô Lynda Carter: This Is My #MeToo Story https://t.co/lPINkURIjK via @thedailybeast
Monday sessions: WHM Sexual Assault and #MeToo Discussion. Refreshments will be served. See you there!
#MarchForOurLives Common sense says that if Gun Free Zones stops mass shootings Rape Free Zones in Hollywood would stop this #Metoo shit. Enough is enough!!  Why do we not have Rape Free Zones? It's common sense!
A darker underside to this @ a societal level is the set of conditions that made her think @ the time she "deserved" this due to her bad choices. Can we support each other &amp; say, "That's a bunch of patriarchal üêéüí©"? We must teach our kids that "No" is *always* an option. #metoo https://t.co/tddaey6BBH

Even though sex was consensual &amp; Stormy does NOT claim to be victim of sexual assault (just really bad taste), the hush money, implied physical harm by a thug &amp; threats of financial ruin by thug lawyers representing Trump, elements of #METoo are in play here #StormyDanielsDay
it's very important that #StormyDaniels recognize the irreparable consequences of her name being associated with the #metoo movement recognizing that she was never a victim on the first place. Take her out of the movement, let her speak her own truth #StormyDanielsDay

I would really like to get an answer, are there any republican families who believe in The March For Our Lives movement?
 Any republican women who support the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement?
Record number of black women are candidates in Alabama:

They're fueled by Democrat Doug Jones' stunning upset Senate win, the #MeToo movement, opposition to Trump and a desire to carry on Obama's legacy

Everyone should be able to feel safe where they live. This is one reason that #MeToo conversations are so important in the housing &amp; homelessness world #TalkItOut
#MeToo was popularized through the stories by famous women. As it has grown it continues to expand to include the experiences of diverse women: domestic workers, farm workers, women in politics. #TalkItOut
We need to make sure that women experiencing homelessness are heard and supported by the #MeToo movement #TalkItOut @ChiFdn4Women https://t.co/fETNQzTZ7V
#MeToo has implications for women's mentorship &amp; access to opportunities. We need to continue to #TalkItOut to ensure women are not penalized by a #MeToo backlash. https://t.co/HdjxeMop0A
It strikes me funny that in the age of #MeToo and Cambridge Analytica, Facebook is complaining about the "burden of consent" when it comes to user data.
Let's start off with Q1: Nearly 6 months since the first allegations broke, we're still talking about #MeToo &amp; sexual harassment. Why is it still important to have this conversation? #TalkItOut
ICYMI: #MeToo has been used by women sharing their personal experiences of sexual harassment, assault &amp; abuse. #MeToo was created in 2006 by @TaranaBurke to support survivors of sexual violence. Learn more about Tarana's work: https://t.co/4JwjYgl9js
What could we achieve if we ended harassment &amp; violence against women &amp; girls? How can men get involved? Join CFW now to #TalkItOut about #MeToo &amp; what is next for the movement!

Have to wonder about all those false rape accusations by white women over the generations since the American Civil War and what the #MeToo stance would be on that, I am curious.

I'm a secretary, type 100wpm.  When I saw women being sexually harassed I spoke up and was blacklisted for it.  When Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon saw #metoo firsthand in Hollywood she said nothing.  She sees no injustice in my not being hired for office work.  Why?  #lesbian
Tomorrow! Come for the free breakfast, stay for conversation about how #MeToo is changing the places we work. https://t.co/dL7XtOEOTp
Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon is best summed up with one word: #crybully, or an oppressor who uses victimhood as a weapon predicated on the knowledge that her audience is too stupid to notice or too evil to care, kind of like her 30 year-silence or cluenessness aqbout #metoo.
I type 100wpm and live off YOUR tax dollars because #metoo predators want hot chicks in the office.  Why would a LESBIAN not speak up more loudly against sexualized hiring that causes it?  Teacher's pet @cynthianixon wants justice...for women...who already spend 86% of money.

Given the number of directors I've interviewed, I'm sure at least one of them is guilty of sexual harassment. If Ellen Barkin's hints are true, I now know who the first one is. Frankly, I'm surprised it took 6 months from the start of the #metoo movement.

STFU Terry Gilliam. HW took advantage of his position of power to sexually assault &amp; harass countless women. It wasn't us women "knowing what they were getting into".  It was a vile man abusing us. I was assaulted while being interviewed to be his nanny for God's sake. #metoo https://t.co/7jJns0p7NB
Alyssa Milano wrote a moving letter to her daughter about the future of #MeToo : https://t.co/w05krnaVg8 https://t.co/7ZMb9OKtCX
#Metoo problem in a nutshell: some men don‚Äôt recognize power differential. ‚ÄúI know enough girls who were in Harvey's suites who were not victims and walked out.‚Äù

Now stop me from breaking crap. There are men who think they decide who is a legit ‚Äúvictim.‚Äù https://t.co/muYEIMtTMc
https://t.co/YasgkbWyS1 @ASCBiology thnks for this article #bully #metoo
Please note: Hazel Hayes hasn't tweeted once about the rape of hundreds of girls over decades in Rotherham, Telford, etc. Not once. 

But an old white guy's wrongthink about #metoo¬†? Why, it's like something bad happened.  #terrygilliam https://t.co/g1tj5lvKIy
No, really, parse this sentence: ‚ÄúIt is a world of victims. I think some people did very well out of meeting with Harvey and others didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Excuse me while I vomit now. #metoo #harveyweinstein  https://t.co/jRuYKE3lPh

So Terry Gilliam has said #MeToo has descended into "mob rule." When Anwar Anzari is lumped in with Harvey Weinstein, I'm struggling to see what's controversial about that statement. https://t.co/LKGC6omGCK
Before I throw out my #AdventuresofBaronMunchausen, my #BrothersGrimm, my #FisherKing, my Brazil, and my #TimeBandits, does anyone have a link what #TerryGilliam said regarding #metoo in its full context and without editorializing?

Terry Gilliam can fuck right off.

Q5: Has the #MeToo movement opened more hiring opportunities for all genders or complicated the issue? #OMCchat https://t.co/aUlOVncfXa

Q4: Do you believe companies have selected more women to interview because of #MeToo? #OMCchat https://t.co/srN6AZ9Xdj
People will naturally become defensive for controversial topics like #MeToo. We tend to think more emotionally and establish a firm position and opinion. I would say the discussion is similar to Politics: not work related and will only cause non-constructive arguments. #OMCchat

In regards to the #MeToo movement and a lack of acknowledgment from schools around the country, this case highlighted common stereotyping with victims and victim-shaming.

The saddest part of the Stormy Daniels interview, is that she felt that "she deserved" having to have sex with Trump because of her decisions that led her to his room.  Pressure sex is not consensual, @StormyDaniels. Keep being brave.

#StormyDanielsDay #MeToo
She clearly stated she does NOT feel like a victim and the sex was consensual even though she was not attracted to him. Did u even watch the interview? She's not aligning herself with the #metoo movement at all. #StormyDanielsDay https://t.co/HUejb6nwtH
Note to folks who are saying Stormy Daniels is #metoo: No. She isn't. She doesn't identify that way, and don't push her into your movement if she doesn't want to join. She has a solid sense of self-worth.
This doesn't sound like consent tbh #StormyDanielsDay #MeToo https://t.co/5C1x1Q1iDx
I appreciate Stormy Daniels not wanting to derail the #MeToo movement but her admitting she didn‚Äôt want to have sex with Trump and doing it anyways to be considered for a job is also a societal problem. Consensual or not. He used his position of power to influence her willingness
Has Obama taken credit for birthing the #MeToo movement?
 Because so many pedophiles and high ranking rapist scumbags were exposed under his watch.

I watched 60 mins with AC and Stormy Daniels. I found her to be credible. She separated herself from #MeToo movement because she said she‚Äôs not a victim.
"You didn't even buy me breakfast," @stormyDaniels owning @Andersoncooper who suggested she's lying abt Trump to get rich off of it. He slut-shamed &amp; victim-doubted her during 60 minutes interview. As Daniels explained, She's a victim of post affair intimidation, not #MeToo story

One thing Stormy didn't realize, once she was threatened she was a #MeToo victim #StormyDaniels
Stormy may not want to align herself with the #MeToo movement, but sex with someone more powerful than you, who you don‚Äôt want to have sex with, because you feel like you put yourself in a bad position is the DEFINITION of the movement. #StormyDanielsDay

One thing that‚Äôs likely to hurt Trump more than anyone may see just yet is the pressuring her into sex. Whether she sees it, or herself as a victim, the resonance with #MeToo and #Weinstein will be impossible to avoid. #StormyDanielsDay #60Minutes
I didn‚Äôt really care about the #StormyDanielsDay until I heard she may have been threatened. I hope #MeToo rises up to support her bc if it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs the same classic intimidation technique sexual harassers &amp; abusers use to silence victims every single day.
Excuse me, yeah Hillary did her job getting off a child rapist and blamed the child 

It‚Äôs relevant because there was a news blackout on the story 

What happened to children‚Äôs rights, I guess you #metoo ppl only care about adults being groped for some attention https://t.co/BUrIT2CtID
Stormy maintains that this is not a #MeToo¬† moment and she‚Äôs not a victim, and that‚Äôs her right. But let‚Äôs not overlook that she forced herself to have sex when she didn‚Äôt want to, and felt she ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù it. 

It‚Äôs a scenario a lot of women have experienced. #StormySunday

Ew.  There should be violins playing during this #StormyDaniels interview on @60Minutes :   she claims it's not a #MeToo moment, then says she felt she had to bang Trump because it was her fault for making a "bad decision".
This is heartbreaking to read/hear. That she felt she had done it to herself &amp; couldn‚Äôt leave. #metoo https://t.co/zpiSbbpIVW

Love Stormy Daniels/Stephanie Clifford saying that her situation is different and she's not co-opting #MeToo and was not a victim. #60Minutes
Stormy Daniels says her story is not part of the #MeToo movement. She says she is not a victim.
Stormy. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this for money.... this is not #MeToo. I never said I was a victim.‚Äù

Cate Blanchett Says Social Media Shouldn‚Äôt Be ‚ÄòJudge And Jury‚Äô When Asked About #MeToo And Woody Allen
#CateBlanchett #WoodyAllen  https://t.co/ZFCSNPzRWN
The things I see in my job, the things a child or grandchild, a spouse, domestic partner, a home health aid, a stranger can do to another human, gets me so angry. I am a social worker for elder abuse because I want to help people who society brushes off because of AGEISM. #MeToo
If you say you believe in the #MeToo movement and think that women should not be allowed to carry firearm's for their own protection then you are a hypocrite.  If more women carried there would be fewer victims of sexual assault.
Organizational and corporate structural mechanisms are required to make meaningful and  long-lasting systemic changes in the workplace.

I'm a secretary, type 100wpm.  When I saw women being sexually harassed I spoke up and was blacklisted for it.  When Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon saw #metoo firsthand in Hollywood she said nothing.  She sees no injustice in my not being hired for office work.  Why?  #lesbian
Tomorrow! Come for the free breakfast, stay for conversation about how #MeToo is changing the places we work. https://t.co/dL7XtOEOTp
Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon is best summed up with one word: #crybully, or an oppressor who uses victimhood as a weapon predicated on the knowledge that her audience is too stupid to notice or too evil to care, kind of like her 30 year-silence or cluenessness aqbout #metoo.
I type 100wpm and live off YOUR tax dollars because #metoo predators want hot chicks in the office.  Why would a LESBIAN not speak up more loudly against sexualized hiring that causes it?  Teacher's pet @cynthianixon wants justice...for women...who already spend 86% of money.

That women have 40-50% upper body strength of men, and 70-75% of lower makes men who enact violence against women all the more cowardly. Yes, women hit men. With a ratio much smaller than men who hit women. For those of you who think #MeToo is "mob rule", consider the FACTS.

I'm a secretary, type 100wpm.  When I saw women being sexually harassed I spoke up and was blacklisted for it.  When Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon saw #metoo firsthand in Hollywood she said nothing.  She sees no injustice in my not being hired for office work.  Why?  #lesbian
Tomorrow! Come for the free breakfast, stay for conversation about how #MeToo is changing the places we work. https://t.co/dL7XtOEOTp
Teacher's Pet @cynthianixon is best summed up with one word: #crybully, or an oppressor who uses victimhood as a weapon predicated on the knowledge that her audience is too stupid to notice or too evil to care, kind of like her 30 year-silence or cluenessness aqbout #metoo.
I type 100wpm and live off YOUR tax dollars because #metoo predators want hot chicks in the office.  Why would a LESBIAN not speak up more loudly against sexualized hiring that causes it?  Teacher's pet @cynthianixon wants justice...for women...who already spend 86% of money.

That women have 40-50% upper body strength of men, and 70-75% of lower makes men who enact violence against women all the more cowardly. Yes, women hit men. With a ratio much smaller than men who hit women. For those of you who think #MeToo is "mob rule", consider the FACTS.

Well, the reaction to Terry Gilliam's interview unfortunately proves his point about a mob mentality some people indulge in under the cover of #MeToo. One statement out of many zeroed in on, used to browbeat him, and avoid any discussion of other, valid notions. (1/2)

Since I called out terry Gilliam, only fair I call out Katy Perry. As much as I love her, her behavior on American idol was everything we're complaining ab men in power doing. She owes that boy an apology at minimum.  #metoo is not gender specific although the majority are women
Hey @verizonfios some feedback: your ad series with the Stranger Things kid in the time of #MeToo #TimesUp is embarrassingly tone deaf. The one thing worse than man-splaining to adult women is boy-splaining. Ugh.

People will naturally become defensive for controversial topics like #MeToo. We tend to think more emotionally and establish a firm position and opinion. I would say the discussion is similar to Politics: not work related and will only cause non-constructive arguments. #OMCchat

Objectively, the data does not suggest a shift in hiring trends. Subjectively, the #MeToo movement can evoke inherent sympathy to motivate hiring of a potentially affected, or in the future affected, individual who is unqualified #OMCchat
A2 In light of #MeToo, men should have less automatic hirings for positions. #OMCchat
Q2: In what ways has #MeToo affected hiring men into openings? #OMCchat https://t.co/n4UmHI5Wwa
