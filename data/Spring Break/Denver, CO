Working at a pharmacy has given me useful insight, so here's a spring break PSA: EVERY year we see a flux of antibiotic prescriptions.... right after spring break. Let that sink it.
Alright #uncbears, as you get back from spring break make sure to head over to Bank of Colorado Arena tomorrow at 3 to cheer on @unco_mbb! https://t.co/sCjDzmFGc2
Yay for exciting and new-to-me books! (Making time to read new things has been one of the hardest parts of transitioning to professor life. Still haven’t figured it out, so I am absolutely delighting in this spring break morning.)
NO WONDER my mom wants me to come home so bad for spring break https://t.co/zQCsFriNDT
My whole life in college I  see niggas use backpacks more during spring break than the actually semester.

Largely took the last week off from politics for some spring break fun with my family (which was great). Wading back into this mess to come up with a column topic is kind of overwhelming.
It has been great to have @casersman home for Spring Break. He is a good cook — he had us dinner more than once. This is the stew from scratch he did. Took 4 hours of cooking. Tasted great. Meal was inspired by a movie we saw. https://t.co/mQRME813lJ
Always a little tricky to get used to watching commercials again each spring. I should take some comfort that it's not a new frustration.
