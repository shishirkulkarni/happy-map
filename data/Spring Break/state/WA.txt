2* pool time was awesome. Thought spring break would have been busy (usually is). Hqd pool to selves. We caught up on the work stress and the fun stuff. Man we miss Disney. Hoping to get to at least Disneyland. Its my 1 w/niece and nephew that always stays with me. WDW 10yrs ago.

What is spring break
I’m happy I actually started working on some verilog over spring break. I haven’t made as much progress as I would have liked, but some is better than none. Averaging 12 hours of sleep a night isn’t really helping, neither is the fact that I’ve watched like 15 movies 😅
I have no phone, a sunburn, broke my permanent retainer, and I can't tell if I'm still hungover or drunk...I would consider this a successful spring break in my book
I’m falling asleep to the sound of a crackling fire place in my parents house. Such a peaceful spring break😌
I am going to Bed now good 🌃 night my Twitter friends hope you'll have a good night and spring break i miss you my honey @BrandonRobbyJa1 ❤ good night everyone have a good night 🌃 #OfflineForBed
