I think year round school would be better! The kids would go the whole year but still have breaks. There would be one week out each month, one month for summer, Christmas, spring break and thanksgiving of course!

Soaking up the final 55 min of Spring Break, while also simultaneously warding off the Monday Anxiety. https://t.co/Zb10oCUPMW
One week for spring break isn’t enough. It needs to be 2 weeks. 
1 week to be a chiflada and lazy
1 week to recover and prep for school

...But only for college students bc we put up with more crap than hs/middle school/etc students.
spring break went by tooooo fast
This spring break has been so relaxing I forgot I had a job lmao
Okay like but I’m still sad that for spring break I only wanted to see a specific person but they were too busy to hang out. I get that I’m not the center of the universe and he has shit to do but I’m still pretty bummed out that I have to wait til May now https://t.co/vLEZ6RELww

I SURVIVED SPRING BREAK 2018
Living in a hotel was awesome the first week, it was okay the first half of spring break, and now it’s just annoying. My house needs to be fixed by the time I come back to SA
Didn’t have my goal physique this spring break but there’s always next year 🤣
My spring break was better than yours. #JustMarried https://t.co/K1QNXywy2J
I really don’t want to hear about all the fun y’all had over spring break because I was stuck at work everyday 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Spring Break has come to a close. We're back at school tomorrow (Monday, March 19th), Star Scholar families! I can't wait to see everyone bright and early, and eager to learn! https://t.co/ijzfqjMgFp
Spring break was just a taste of how my summer is going to be, and I can't wait.
spring break? more like spring broke
Next spring break my a$$ is going to Cancun #senioryear
I worked all of spring break...
well it’s official, this spring break was the most boring, uneventful, and non-productive break ever
spring break felt like a weekend not a full week
We hope you had a wonderful Spring Break! Welcome back! https://t.co/FIW8R2ATQ7

Spring Break felt as long as a normal weekend
I need another spring break
And just like that Texas cleansed you of all your spring break sins🤗
I got dark af this spring break 😩
Spring break is over and I didn’t do anything. https://t.co/XhGkYZND82
To finish off spring break, we had a three foot rattler in the neighbor’s driveway. Hubs killed it but we enjoyed some late spring break excitement. Most exciting thing to happen in the cul-de-sac in three years
#marchmadness Last day of spring break watching some games and switching to @NBCLilBigShots What a game @aggiembk, you definitely busted my bracket even more. #Thankful for the week and all the adventures it brought.
I think Texas got a little too drunk over spring break because this weather is crazy😨
RIP to all the money I spent for spring break

Spring Break gives us an opportunity to center our thoughts and actions, reconnect with ourselves, spend quality uninterrupted time with our families, and rekindle our commitment to continue making a difference in public education. Let’s do this!!! https://t.co/U2qlXrF2jV
Went away for spring break.
Came back to some delightful deliveries on my doorstep.

#goldsgym https://t.co/zVFHrDJr0C
That’s what happens when people go out and act crazy for spring break. 🤣💀

If spring break was a glimpse of what summer has in store... I need to start saving money
This is the first spring break I didn’t go to the beach and I miss the feeling of coming home with tan skin, beach waves, and that feeling when you’ve been away from home and you plop down on your bed
where did spring break go???
Yo we was on spring break..
from having fun at the beach, to exploring some haunted bridges and hotels, to hiking to find a waterfall, and finally jumping off some cliffs to end it; this was an eventful, and unquestionably memorable spring break. ☀️ https://t.co/MmNA1XKjC8
Me, during spring break: "I'm going to wait until Sunday to catch up on studying!"
Me, on Sunday: sleeps in, cleans, does taxes, cries, sleeps some more
RIP spring break 2018 ⚰️

Shoutout to every professor that assumed I’d have all this free time over spring break to work on “surprise” essay revisions and presentations.
I’m exhausted and saddened by the end of Spring Break. Even with all the great academic/professional stuff to look forward to, I’m emotionally unfit to deal with the remaining semester.
WE’RE BACK IN ACTION! ‼️‼️

Got sent home from work super early today by my boss to cut into my overtime hours. Not very pleased about it, because today was going a lot smoother than any other spring break day I worked and it felt like it might as well have been pay for standing around.
Spring break was a little crazy but that’s ok. 💁🏽‍♀️🥃🍻❤️ #BadDecisions https://t.co/2E98Ox6TgK
Hello Twitter, I would like to leave in writing that I caved over Spring Break and smoked cigarettes. I would also like to say that I’m not back on my bullshit, so it all ends today

This girl this year at spring break was not even close to Fay last year, Fay much cooler and more chill than Jenns ugly personality, Jenn was an example of a complete bastardized abomination not just to me but other guys as well, Fay was not like that last year, Fay awesome 👏.
