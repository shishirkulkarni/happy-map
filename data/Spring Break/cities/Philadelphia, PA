His curve has looked sharp this spring, w/ good break &amp; location.

In 2016 hitters posted a batting average against of .235 against Lugo's curve, with a sizable bump to .288 in '17. Saw a drop in whiff % as well from 14.01 in '16 to 10.26 in '17.

Look for rebound in '18.

So the first week back from spring break went: School, snow day, snow day, day off, day off. Shiiiiit 2 more months of THAT, I can do.
Another Spring Break day will be removed in April thanks to this spring snow storm. 
Kids thought they'd be hanging out all day on their iPad and laptops. Hahaaa. 
Time to pull your weight kiddies. Mommy can't shovel, so kids are on snow patrol.

Im Still In Miami For Spring Break 🌴
Work Sunday then I’m off from school for spring break and don’t return to work for 3 whole days
