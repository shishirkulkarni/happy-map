So the first week back from spring break went: School, snow day, snow day, day off, day off. Shiiiiit 2 more months of THAT, I can do.
Another Spring Break day will be removed in April thanks to this spring snow storm. 
Kids thought they'd be hanging out all day on their iPad and laptops. Hahaaa. 
Time to pull your weight kiddies. Mommy can't shovel, so kids are on snow patrol.

Happy Spring...uhh? Anyway, take advantage of the day off. Catch up on schoolwork; do something nice for your family; get a workout and break a sweat; set your mind to being the best teammate and most coachable athlete you can. The snow will melt, eventually #HillsPride

Next week is supposed to be spring break but there's still some snow on the ground and it's still freezing out
I need these storms to chill for the next 3 weeks at least. I can’t afford to not learn the curriculum. I’m pretty sure I’m only getting 1 exam in each class before Spring Break and I refuse to be the fool bc Mother Nature decides to shake the table. 🚬❄️
Snow day across the region today, but my district is open. No problem at all, Spring Break is intact! 10am early dismissal.

Many schools dismissing early this morning to ensure they do not lose another day of spring break. Scattered snow showers already breaking out but early indications the steadiest snow is unlikely to move in until 2-3 PM regardless.  Accum forecast of 6-12 in remains on track.
Dumbest policy. No kids are going to school on spring break. Red to go back to adding days in June! https://t.co/Nmsw9IP2KS
So let me get this straight. During spring break, we still have to go school on Monday? Lmao ridley is on some shit.
