This may be the only truly sunny/warm day of my Spring Break. So I’m going to spend time outside while I can!
Athletes make sure we move this Spring Break! If you can get to the gym get to the gym. If not, get outside and pick heavy stuff up and put it down quickly! Push ups, air squats, burpees everything works!! If you need ideas get in touch and we can work something out!!
When your son's Spring Break doesn't match with yours and you need a color-coded spreadsheet to visualize who of the 6 babysitters are watching him at what times...you just might be a working designer mom.
