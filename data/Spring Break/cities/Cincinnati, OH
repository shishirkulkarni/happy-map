Spring break is so close, but yet so far away.
Fun fact: Ft Myers is where I first got hooked on @PLLTVSeries . My bff HAD to watch it on Spring Break. And I could hear her freaking out about the Toby-A reveal from across the house. When I got home from that trip I instantly started binge-watching 💁🏽‍♀️ @imarleneking

Fr don’t know how to school after spring break
I realize I've had this luggage for a while, but, during my @SpiritAirlines flight today the framing got seriously bent. I've flown every spring break on numerous different airlines and not had any issues until senior year.
Can spring break last for the rest of this semester??
We hope you have been enjoying your spring break. When we return, we will hold elections! Be prepared with your speeches. https://t.co/dZE2CJ7dA7

Im not sure if ill ever fully recover from spring break this year....
Excellent article on the effects of closing school cafeterias during breaks. I would also add how often institutions fail to communicate this to students until it's too late -- something I learned the hard way my freshman year. @nytimes https://t.co/YrhGzq5lNK

Some girls go on spring break just for photo shoots. Relax home girl, drink a beer and live in the moment. Your friends are tired of being your photographer I’m sure. 🙄
Did I study enough for this exam? No. But did I get to have a stressfree last spring break where I didn’t think about school? ... Still no. 😂
Why did spring break last about 5 minutes.... 😤

I spent so much money on this spring break. 😪😭all this food, all this liquor, the little stuff we paid to get in places for fun, me having to buy an iPhone for my friend because I pushed him into the pool. No more spending. Well after this 30 I'm blowing on food at the aiport.
