Ever since spring break has stared, I've been on facetime with Camila from nearly the moment I wake up until the moment she finally tries to get rid of me to go to bed.
Nothing quite says spring break like watching an average of three people arrested per hour and 2 more having the paramedics called. That's what having the number 1 beach gets you every year.
We’re back from Spring Break with two big district games at home this week!! Come out tomorrow as we take on Spruce Creek @ 5:30 &amp; 7 🐑 #yahtzee
