Dear spring break,

        PLEASE HURRY!!
Glad I took PTO because I have not had a spring break since sophomore year of high school, since I did my freshman &amp; sophomore year of college during my junior &amp; senior year &amp; UVU’s spring break &amp; ALA’s spring break never matched up so I did not get a spring break for two years
If anyone’s got any spare change, HMU bc spring break is next week and my bank account is NOT ready :)

I'm less jealous of people going to party at the beach for Spring Break and more jealous of people in New Orelans, New York, the Rockies, etc.... Experience life for me while I work 40 hours this week yall ✊😔

Girls Snapchat stories all spring break...☘️🍸🍻 https://t.co/2SlLJ6SI6n
Man spring break was one for the books. Idk how to go back to normal life.
I literally can’t stand it being such terrible weather here. We are almost always able to hike a little bit by now. I’m getting frustrated enough that we might head to Tennessee in a few weeks on Spring Break.
I just need spring break at this point
"How was spring break"
We got frisked by some cops, 2 traffic violations, the van &amp; luggage got searched for drugs, and the door fell off... so pretty awesome actually. https://t.co/81uCdacqXF

Spring break is over for me. Last night of freedom 😭
usually I’m so siked for the weekend, but this weekend means the end of spring break which means classes start back on Monday and I’m about to drop out bc I can’t hang
I’m one of those cool “people” that tweet about spring break that is in a week. Can’t wait to spend the week at home with my babies 💖💖 #Adventures #CantWait
Everyone is on spring break or at a bar getting trashed and I’m just living life in my bed with my Shepherd watching Cops 🤙🏽
We hope you all had a great spring break! 

Don’t forget to sign up for our Engaging With Games workshop on March 24th! 😊🎲

Back from spring break and now I’m lonely in my stupid little dorm 😭
Guys this professor of mine puts deadlines at times like 5pm Saturday during Spring Break. I feel like I'm being tortured.

Spring break is typically a time to un-wind, but it's so important for athletes to stay active. 

@OhioBobcats coach @daknotestine has a few tips for you to stay active and come back ready to show off all your hard work.

Listened to a podcast AND an audiobook track in the same day. Probably a once in a lifetime thing. 5 conditions made this possible: 1) spring break, 2) scanning text &amp; converting to pdf, 3) dishwashing, 4) cooking soup, 5) sewing.
