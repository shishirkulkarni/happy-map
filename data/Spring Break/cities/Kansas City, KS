Welcome to Spring Break, AKA research week @UMKansasCity
I was looking one way, towards spring break. Then I looked away for one second and saw school. I’m still freaking out that it left me that quick.

I have to be honest, Twitter family. I'm coming out of Spring Break discouraged. I've got too many students who've been set up by the system to fail, and I'm weary of watching it play out.

Okay. So listen. Spring break is almost here. I’m almost done with my freshman year of college. I’ve meet too many amazing people to count. I’ll be on the beach in around 3 months. Life is great.
Honest question: why do people willingly go to really cold places during Spring Break? I did that once. Wouldn’t recommend it
being sick during spring break is 100% the worst
Do not forget that SPRING BREAK is next week!  Enjoy your time and see you on Monday, April 2!  #esmsbestyearever
