Spring break is kind of a tease
At 5 singles... Broke back at 4-5 and 5-6, got down 2-6 in the 2nd set tiebreaker. Came back to 5-6 before finally falling. 
It would’ve been easier to give up but we battled well. Bittersweet end to Spring Break matches. 
Bright Side: Beach Day tomorrow!!
The extra hour of sunlight we aquired over spring break means that practice will now be at 5:30 every weekday. It does not mean that you will feel like there is more time in the day to do the things you promised to do. We're sorry.

what's the ~cool and laidback~ way to tell your therapist that you missed your last appointment because spring break and daylight savings started at the same time and it threw off your schedule and made you dissociate so hard that you forgot what day it was
I'm pretty sure I was busier over spring "break" than I've been this whole semester
My professor is a lunatic for choosing the first day back from spring break to be an exam day.
