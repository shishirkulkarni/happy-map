This week did NOT feel like spring break!😫
Everyone on spring break but I still have a week of classes left smh
Reasons why tests shouldn’t be the Monday after spring break:
1) I haven’t looked at anything in over a week
2) I had a nightmare that I failed
3) I’m probably not going to study until midnight
4) Monday’s are really not my day

First day of spring break involved sleeping and reading comic books. Second will involve eating out and seeing movies. After that spring break is over cuz I got a shitton of papers to grade.
Inspired by today’s homily, sometimes  just being consistent can bring great benefits. After a particularly busy week &amp; the upcoming one being a little lighter, I’m ready to EMBRACE the mundane. Spring Break over? Back to classes/work? EMBRACE the mundane this week. #EmbraceLent
Spring is almost here!  Time to break out the hiking boots.

Cool time of year where you get to see who will get strung up in the golliwogs when we finally over-through the rich. *hint* they all went out of the country for spring break for the millionth time in their life or they got dumb drunk in Soulard tonight.
Can I just go back to the beginning of spring break? I don’t like this whole “reality” thing..
Well now my neighbors are back and all I hear is showtunes all around me. Spring break is over I guess.
The real baddies just now posting they spring break pics. They had to let y'all finish, no Kanye.
I see all these spring break and St. Patrick’s days snaps and I feel a profound sense of loneliness creeping in. 

Graduate school can’t come soon enough.
Best part of spring break? Getting pictures from some of our sweet @FairwayElem 2nd grade Girl Scouts who spent the night at the zoo and found our awesome mascot! Great job girls! 💚💛🦅 #EaglePride #SpringBreak2018 @apfairway @DrDaveCobb @ROCK_Supt https://t.co/NUFIseYAVJ

I’ve been playing “Up Down” so much on Spring Break, the locals now know you. @MorganCWallen  🤙🏼 #cometocancun
To top it off, SIU students, one of the largest population groups in Jackson County, are completely disenfranchised, they have no way to vote! 

They set early voting dates over Spring Break, making it far more difficult for students to register and vote on Election Day!
I just entered @albionfit’s Spring Break Swimsuit Giveaway!! You should too! https://t.co/VhykufZEvI
It kills me, when I met the Chancellor and Mayor, they focused on one thing. The whole meeting, they stressed how important it was to bring SIU students back to SIU. Yet, they never ask for student input! The only time that these officials are on campus, is over Spring Break!!

PSA FOR ALL GUYS WHO AREN'T OR ON SPRING BREAK

1. If they can barely walk DON'T FUCK THEM

2. How they dress does NOT mean their consent

3. Stand up for women being sexually harrased, you wouldn't want that if it was your sister or daughter

I say every year I’m going on spring break but don’t go . I’m going next year regardless of people coming with me or not.
The only bad thing about girls going to spring break is that for the next 16 weeks they’ll post pictures saying “Take me back 😩”

Just go the fuck back? You were only in Florida for literally 4 days. You moved one fucking time zone for less than a full week.

Not a big deal.
