My goal is to return to Striker by Wednesday, but some things occurred this weekend that led me to treat this week like what it is (for me), Spring Break. If I end up going past that goal, well, I'll be frustrated, but sometimes the cookie just crumbles that way.
Thank goodness for Spring Break, starting at the end of this week! 🙏🏻

I totally disagree with this notion that shortening spring break in PGCPS negatively impacts teacher performance and morale.  I cannot jump on this bandwagon!  I think you have to look closer to home if you are truly concerned about teacher morale and performance.

Happy Spring Break 2018 CV! Stay safe.  Enjoy the time. Rest, exercise, eat well, laugh and do something kind. Oh and wear your seatbelt.
Happy Spring Break! If you're out of town this week, have an amazing time! (we're only a little bit jealous). If you're heading out of town in the near future, give us a call :)

Only in the DMV schools close for nothing, and then go and take away half of your spring break, Pathetic. out of the whole season, I would say 4 days MAX legitimately required a closure. (cold day, wind day, Wednesday, ?)
I also wanna state that my theory professor is trash for giving us a paper due during spring break.
