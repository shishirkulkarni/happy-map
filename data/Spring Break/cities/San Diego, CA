Spring Break is the perfect time to start preparing for your June Subject Tests. Research shows that a study group of 3-5 students works best. You learn by explaining the material to friends. AP exams are NOT the same as Subject tests! Use @khanacademy #SubjectTests #testing https://t.co/fmGjixalAd
