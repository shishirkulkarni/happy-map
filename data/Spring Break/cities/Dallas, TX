Today is the last day of spring break. So you can A. Spend the day getting homework done and be ready for school on Monday, or B. Procrastinate and not get any work done. We suggest B because it’s the most likely to happen out of the two.
I wished the school year would go by as fast as spring break did 🤦🏼‍♀️

I deep clean my restroom every Saturday morning, and I maintain it through the week. 

Ask my sons what they did this Spring Break, and they'll respond:

"We learned how to properly clean a toilet."

I told them girls like boys who are clean, and to stay away from a dirty girl.🤣

this has been literally the worst spring break of my entire life.

what was supposed to be a fun and educational college experience was actually a nightmare of unappreciated hard work and some insecure dude using his power to make people feel bad about themselves.
spring break 2018 was a good one and can’t wait for more :)
Next year I’m taking my spring break talents to the money 💰...... I will be sitting that trip out to run it up.
