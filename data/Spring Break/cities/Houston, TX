GIVE UP your spring break, give up sleeping in, give up all the non important bullshit and GO GRIND. You won’t be successful by going to Padre Island on spring break, I promise. Grind in your 20’s so you don’t have a boss by the time you’re 30.

I’ll be honest, partying the next few days sounds like a stellar way to spend Spring Break. Honestly, I’d rather spend the day pointlessly driving around with someone, eating, and watching movies till we fall asleep. I doubt that’s how tomorrow will go.
