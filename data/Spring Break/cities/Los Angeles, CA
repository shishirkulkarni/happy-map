But then it kept on raining,
And finals were draining
But, alas, remembered--it’s Senior Year!

Quick break b4 my last customer. Pouring rain. Cold. More winter than spring. It’s nice in its way.
Wear sunscreen. College kids on spring break aren't usually the first to whip out huge tubes of sunscreen to slather on. While getting a tan may prove you spent your break on a beach, it can also be a source of skin cancer, so make sure to protect yourself. #stayhealthy
There is nothing quite like listening to sorority girls explain why they’re getting spray tans before going to Mexico for spring break to fraternity bros.

Men don’t make me happy. Netflix and binge eating on my day off during spring break inside all day while it’s raining outside makes me happy.
all spring 'break' did for me is make it harder for me to sit in these skool chairs all day. my body is too old for this.
I can’t even enjoy my spring break the way I want because I have to work
I really hope these couple of days we’re missing don’t affect how much time we get off for spring break
