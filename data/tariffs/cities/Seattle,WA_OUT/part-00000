#POTUS Trump imposed these #tariffs by claiming them as a matter of national security, and that has offended many of our trade partners have said that they will retaliate with their own tariffs on US goods, many aimed directly to injure politicians. The cycle begins.	0.11345925925925927

#Tariffs and #Inflation go hand in hand, the impacts will be long and deep for months to come. Anything that has steel in it will cost more. Who pays? Us the consumer. Inflation not good for Mortgage Rates #5StarLender 206-601-3426 #KeithAkada https://t.co/clCofVH35q	0.2415
#Tariffs make sense as part of a coherent manufacturing strategy. We must #replaceNAFTA and rethink our approach to #globalization. https://t.co/9aaI3Ujj9N via @TheStandWA #bettertrade #trade https://t.co/qcnmoLsTlz	0.1315130434782609

.@ddale8 finds even #Trump supporters are dubious that #tariffs will help ailing steel industry. And they're particularly opposed to punishing #Canada. Who says voters are easily fooled?	0.08434000000000001

Considering Trump's dream wall will be built with tons of steel, he should probably get some new estimates.	0.2405428571428571
I think that we give the #POTUS more credit for what happens in the #economy most of the time, but the recently announced #tariffs could genuinely have a direct effect on the economy.	0.09029333333333334
I worried at the beginning of the year that the #US could enter into a #TradeWar and I worry that these #tariffs could initiate it. A 25% tariff on #steel and 10% on aluminum was proposed and #Canada and #Mexico could get out of them if they sign #NAFTA	0.08024137931034483
If your biz is 1 of many in #WA likely impacted by Trump admin's  #tariffs on #steel &amp; #aluminum, take note:  U.S. Commerce now has procedure for excluding products from tariffs (under limited circumstances). Requests for exceptions accepted starting today https://t.co/ggpKFAnWpR	0.02345

The #tariffs announced last week have an impact on #FreeTrade and without it, the whole idea of the #SuperCycle could come crashing down and we could end it prematurely. We are in the process of negotiating #NAFTA and the #POTUS wants to use these tariffs as leverage.	0.02345

There’s a lot of background to Trump’s surprise decision to impose #tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, none of it comforting ... https://t.co/8aomuLYchJ @CWintersWriter	0.18716250000000004
To people claiming @realDonaldTrump found his moral compass in #tariffs, SHUT THE FUCK UP! When it came to nazis in Charlottesville, he came up empty, but regarding tariffs… Morality plays NO PART in ANYTHING that this narcissistic swindler ever has, or ever will do! #antichirst	0.21552857142857146
Trump's #tariffs will do little to rebalance US-China trade, says @theeiu, though they will signal a commitment to punitive measures targeting #China over #IntellectualProperty. https://t.co/sIrbTyoCgS	0.1315130434782609
What do #Trump's tariffs mean for #NAFTA talks? The #US has exempted #Mexico and #Canada from the new import #tariffs, supporting the likelihood that the agreement will be revised, rather than scrapped entirely, says @TheEIU https://t.co/OKZsFXLP6y	0.24747500000000003
Why is anyone surprised that steel tariffs are really pissing off the EU, which originated as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952?	0.09106666666666667
