Of course, many #freetrade-ers are genuinely alarmed by the #Trumptariffs. But surely part of their vehemence stems from the sheer shock of losing total control over the national #trade debate. #tariffs
Here are the ten states that Trump's #tariffs would hit hardest (with cost estimates):

Texas = $968M
New York = $758M
California = $525M
Florida = $524M
Utah = $504M
Ohio = $498M
Illinois = $495M
New Jersey = $477M
Pennsylvania = $468M
Louisiana = $449
