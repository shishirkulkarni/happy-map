The #tariffs, the reliance on #Navarro, the firing of #Tillerson and his replacement by #Pompeo, all signal that #Trump has determined to disregard all counsel of moderation and rule instead through instinct, belligerence, and ignorance.
With tariffs again prominent in American and global discourse, it could be useful to revisit their origins and connection with our home, the Boston Manufacturing Company and Francis Cabot Lowell himself. https://t.co/gqSIitmkvj #history #America #museum #tariff #tariffs #Waltham https://t.co/owDUIO5MYv

My econ class has had lively discussions on #tariffs. As an adjunct, I hope others will support the idea I proposed to them of a #tariff on schools (a tuition tax) who hire adjuncts below the salary of FT profs. Not popular with my class yet, but I'm sure they'll come around.

The #tariffs announced last week have an impact on #FreeTrade and without it, the whole idea of the #SuperCycle could come crashing down and we could end it prematurely. We are in the process of negotiating #NAFTA and the #POTUS wants to use these tariffs as leverage.
Why is anyone surprised that steel tariffs are really pissing off the EU, which originated as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952?

#Tariffs make sense as part of a coherent manufacturing strategy. We must #replaceNAFTA and rethink our approach to #globalization. https://t.co/9aaI3Ujj9N via @TheStandWA #bettertrade #trade https://t.co/qcnmoLsTlz
#POTUS Trump imposed these #tariffs by claiming them as a matter of national security, and that has offended many of our trade partners have said that they will retaliate with their own tariffs on US goods, many aimed directly to injure politicians. The cycle begins.
I worried at the beginning of the year that the #US could enter into a #TradeWar and I worry that these #tariffs could initiate it. A 25% tariff on #steel and 10% on aluminum was proposed and #Canada and #Mexico could get out of them if they sign #NAFTA
I think that we give the #POTUS more credit for what happens in the #economy most of the time, but the recently announced #tariffs could genuinely have a direct effect on the economy.
.@ddale8 finds even #Trump supporters are dubious that #tariffs will help ailing steel industry. And they're particularly opposed to punishing #Canada. Who says voters are easily fooled?
